                 Flex doesn't actually add the libraries to our code unless we
                 instantiate some of their objects ([lb] read that library-path
                 includes the complete library - but maybe only if it's
                 actually used - or maybe (probably) it's because this is
                 library-path and not include-libraries...).
                 We include these libraries here so we can import the libraries
                 in Main_Toolbar.mxml, which tricks Class_Loader into working.

       NOTE: We are not using the "signed" RSLs - those signed by Adobe which
