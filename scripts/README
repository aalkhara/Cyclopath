Note: Many of the scripts in this directory are stale and have not been tested
in a long time. Use caution.

2011.08.08: I [lb] cleaned up the directory a bit, moving files into
subdirectories. This makes it easier to identify scripts that are actively used
and maintained, and to identify scripts that were one-offs used long ago.

In general:

* scripts/analyze : infrequently used scripts to analyze the database and other
                    types of data and not guaranteed to be up-to-date;

* scripts/daily   : scripts that are run daily by a nightly cronjob, and should
                    (must?) all be up-to-date;

* scripts/dev     : scripts used infrequently by developers for certain tasks 
                    and not likely to work or be up-to-date;

* scripts/routing_analysis : FIXME: Not sure, yet, but probably live, 
                                    so probably belongs somewhere other than in
                                    scripts/;

* scripts/setupcp : mostly one-off scripts used at one time to import data or
                    to calculate values for various tables, so some scripts
                    will no longer work (like the CcpV1 scripts under magic/);
                    but also some scripts to manage users and group
                    memberships;

* scripts/util    : scripts used by other scripts in scripts/; also includes 
                    scripts used by multiple other components, e.g.,
                    util/build_id.pl is used by pyserver and flashclient;

* scripts/        : scripts that are used frequently and interactively by
                    developers are kept in the top-level scripts/ directory.

SYNC_ME: Search: name of the scripts directory.
         The name of the parent directory ('scripts') is used by some of the
         scripts.
