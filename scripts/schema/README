The files in this directory are SQL scripts which upgrade the database schema.
In other words, if you want to change the database schema, you should write a
SQL script to make the necessary changes and put it in this directory. Scripts
should be numbered consecutively in the order they should be applied and
should not include the string "revert.sql" in the filename (sometimes scripts
also have a reverse version; a script which reverses 'nnn-foo.sql' is called
'nnn-foo-revert.sql' by convention).

Never change scripts after the script has landed on the trunk (unless
otherwise arranged with the trunk manager). If you need further changes, write
a new script.

To upgrade your database, run schema-upgrade.py in the parent directory. It
will figure out which scripts are needed and run them.
