# 2013.05.08: The following libraries:
#
#   LAPACK — Linear Algebra PACKage
#   GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)
#   ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Soft)
#   SciPy
#   OpenOPT Framework
#   DSDP -- Software for Semidefinite Programming
#   CVXOPT -- Python Software for Convex Optimization
#
#   were installed by [lb] trying to get a TSP solution
#   working -- I was under the disillusion that OpenOPT's
#   TSP library would be simple to install and work well.
#
#   Ha!
#
#   My first chance to decide to not use OpenOPT was when
#   I first came across its Web site, shamelessly colorful
#   and full of distracting, dancing widgets. Who wants to
#   partay like it's nineteen ninety nine?
#
#   My next chance to decide to not use OpenOPT was going
#   through dependencies. OO claimed to only need one or two,
#   but each of those needed a few more. Fortunately, most of
#   the libraries were easy to find, download and install. But
#   some were tricky to build (I love reading incorrect build
#   instructions on the project page and find the correct ones
#   in discussion threads elsewhere). And others would build
#   but will then something obscure would fail -- in one case
#   because the library was too recent for another library and
#   its old, deprecated API had finally been removed.
#
#   Then there's the fact that it's OOFramework. They have a
#   beautiful Web page straight out of 1999. They have lots of
#   seemingly good usage examples. But my experience trying to
#   get TSP to run was dismal. No matter how I messed with the
#   weights, I couldn't get any of the solvers to pick the best
#   path, which meant I couldn't really solve my TSP problem. Not
#   to be picky, but I want a perfect solution. Also, not being
#   able to effectively set weights meant that I couldn't weight
#   one node so heavily on input that no one would go there (start
#   node) and weight another node so much on output that no one
#   would leave there (finish node). So either I was messing up
#   something that seems like it should be super simple, or the
#   OOFramework TSP is wrong or not documented correctly/well.
#
#   Given a normal networkx directed graph, e.g., where [{2,3,1.0},{3,2,2.0}]
#   means nodes 2 and 3 connect and 2->3 is a cost of 1.0 and the reverse is a
#   cost of 2.0, I thought this might work, given documentation at OO's nook:
#
#     from openopt import *
#     import networkx as nx
#
#     my_graph = [
#      (0, 1, .01,), (0, 2, .01,), (0, 4, .01,),
#      # NOTE: No (1, *) because you can't leave node 1 (final node).
#      (2, 0, .01,), (2, 1, .01,), (2, 4, .01,),
#      # NOTE: No (*, 3) because you can't enter node 3 (start node).
#      (3, 0, .13,), (3, 1, .12,), (3, 2, .11,), (3, 4, .01,),
#      (4, 0, .01,), (4, 1, .01,), (4, 2, .01,),]
#
#     G = nx.DiGraph()
#     G.add_node(1) # Since we didn't define any edges.
#     G.add_weighted_edges_from(my_graph)
#
#     # Trying the 'glpk' solver.
#
#     p = TSP(G, objective='cost', goal='min', start=0, returnToStart=False)
#     r = p.solve('sa')
#     # oologfcn.OpenOptException: input graph has node 1 that does not lead
#     #                            to any other node; solution is impossible

#
#     # Trying min again:
#     p = TSP(G, objective='cost', goal='min', start=0, returnToStart=False)
#     r = p.solve('sa')
#     print(r.Edges)

#
#     # Trying min again:

#     #  (1, 2, {'weight': 100.0}), # WRONG: Final node, drr!
#     #  (2, 0, {'weight': 0.01})]
#
#   As seen above, on a graph with five nodes where you can't leave the finish
#   node, and where all but one of the exits of the start node is expensive,
#   the algorithm (a) won't always pick the least expensive start node exit,
#   and (b) won't always visit the finish node last. So frustrating!!
#   (Though, in the examples, I see 'time' as another parameter, so maybe
#   I just needed to specify a time and a weight... bah, whatever, the alleyoop
#   service uses an awesome custom-build permutation iterator and its own TSP
#   that can handle first and final destinations.)
#
#   But really [lb] is happy that networkx does TSP (well, it kinda does
#   TSP, it really just calculates all possible paths and then we look for
#   Hamiltonian cycles and decide which one is the shortest (a Hamiltonian
#   cycle visits every node in a graph)). To be honest, I skipped past networkx
#   because it's so generic (which I guess TSP is, too) and also because most
#   TSP chatter online is about "constraint programming"... which is way, way
#   too complex for me. I'm also guessing my search terms weren't optimal, even
#   though you'd expect "python travelling salesperson" or "networkx visit
#   all nodes" to be hit-worthy. I guess I'm just not a graph theorist, so I
#   don't know the correct terms.
#
#   I'm also happy to finally have an excuse to use networkx, since I've seen
#   it before and have been impressed by its simplicity. I think [rp] used it
#   for the original route finder, before just brewing his own solution (using
#   simple Python lookups of nodes and edges and using the norvig library to
#   find the shortest path). And I think [cd] may have looked into networkx
#   when researching finders for multimodal (she picked GraphServer).
#
#   Anywhoway, I'm keeping this code and for some reason deciding to keep this
#   blathering comment. The install code below I'm keeping because I've
#   installed these libraries on my development machine, and I like to keep
#   records of installed code; also because if new code doesn't work on new
#   machines, it might be because maybe one of the libraries below really
#   does need to be installed. And this comment I'm just keeping, mostly
#   because I don't want to visit OOFramework ever again, and I want to
#   remember my experience with it to be sure I remember not to revisit
#   OOFramework ever again. (No offense to OOFramework, you seem like a very
#   nice piece of software, but I think we just got off on the wrong foot.)
#
#   See the alleyoopcat service for the TSP implementation that uses just
#   networkx.all_simple_paths.
