# - the name of the postgres schema containing instance-specific data
# - the name of the tilecache layer for this instance

# should be given a unique server name that corresponds to a valid Apache
# virtual host; and each Apache virtual host should have PythonInterpreter set
# to match the instance name.

# DEVS: For server_names, you can use 'localhost', or whatever Apache maps to
