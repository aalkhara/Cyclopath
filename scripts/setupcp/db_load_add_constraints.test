/* DEVs: If scripts/setupcp/db_load_add_constraints.sql fails, it's
         easiest to debug by using this shell to run the SQL to the point
         of failure, and then committing the transaction. Otherwise, for
         every subsequent error in the SQL, you'll have to rerun the
         constraints script from the beginning, which gets tedious very fast,
         mainly since the script takes a while to run.

         Basically, copy db_load_add_constraints.sql herein and delete
         from the point of failure up to the commit; run the script;
         then delete the code you just ran and paste in the previously
         deleted code, fix it, and run this script again. Repeat as needed.
