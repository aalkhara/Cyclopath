This file documents Cyclopath security procedures. It is not secret, but it is
placed here in the codebase and not on the wiki as defense-in-depth.


Password Management and Log-In
------------------------------

The goal here is to be approximately as secure as MediaWiki, as the same
usernames and passwords travel through there. As in MW, we transfer passwords
in the clear on login, but subsequent requests are authenticated using an
opaque token. All data is transferred using plain HTTP, no SSL.

The token consists of the MD5 hash of concatenation of the hashed
password/salt plus several other items hopefully unique to the particular
client (e.g. IP address, user agent). The goal is to make it difficult to take
someone's token and use it to authenticate from somewhere else.
