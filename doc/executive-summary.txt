               ============================================

Goal
----

We intend for our system to become the central clearinghouse for Twin Cities
bicyclists' route planning and navigation needs. Its key advantage over other
systems is that it is user-maintained --- this enables it to not only capture
where cyclists really go and what they really use better than centralized
systems, but also to respond more quickly to an ever-changing landscape.


Vision
------

Our vision for the system includes the following key features:

1. A database of place-based information important to bicyclists, created and
   maintained collaboratively.

   Where can one find water? Restrooms? Bike shops? Road construction?
   Currently, this critical information is only available piecemeal from
   hundreds of different sources, and it changes constantly.

   However, bicyclists are bursting to share what they know, and working
   together, with little effort necessary on the part of any one person, they
   can build a central, up-to-date, repository of great value.

2. A cyclist-oriented map of the city's transportation network, maintained
   collaboratively.

   Paper maps become quickly outdated, and centrally maintained maps suffer
   from information overload and narrowness of perspective.

   However, bicyclists are intimately familiar with the places they go
   frequently; our system can collect this distributed knowledge and present
   it in a coherent way. Members of the community will edit the map and
   monitor the edits of others, producing an accurate, up-to-date map matching
   precisely where cyclists want to go.

3. Personalized bikeability ratings for every significant road and trail in
   the metro area.

   Currently, high-quality bicycle maps exist for the Twin Cities. However,
   these maps have two significant failings: their bikeability ratings are by
   necessity generic, not personalized, and they carry ratings for only a
   small subset of the city's bikeable surfaces.

   A cyclist will enter ratings for roads and trails that he or she knows; the
   system will then, using sophisticated information processing techniques,
   combine these ratings with ratings entered by others. It will then be able
   to predict, with high accuracy, the ratings the cyclist would give to other
   roads and trails -- producing for each user a fully personalized bicycle
   map of the entire city.

4. Sophisticated, bicycle-centric route planning.

   A bicyclist will be able to quickly obtain a personalized point-to-point
   route considering many factors: shortest route, fewest hills, prettiest,
   least traffic, and others. He or she will be able to weigh these factors to
   obtain a route through unfamiliar areas that precisely matches his or her
   immediate mood and needs.

   Route planning can use either the personalized bikeability ratings
   discussed above, or, for users who prefer it or do not wish to log in,
   standardized ratings based on Clark's Roadway Suitability Index or some
   other generic measure.


How We're Getting There
-----------------------

The project is led by Reid Priedhorsky, and work proceeds under an empirical,
user-centered methodology. Reid is an enthusiastic cyclist and a 4th-year
Ph.D. student specializing in human-computer interaction. He is trained in the
relevant techniques and methods: spatial databases, GIS, user-centered design,
and requirements analysis.

The project is supervised by Dr. Loren Terveen. Loren has extensive research
experience in computer-mediated communication and computer-supported
cooperative work; his current work is in online communities and location-based
services.

We're not pushing a technology solution onto users. Rather, we're
investigating user needs -- using surveys, interviews, and other tools -- and
evolving our initial design ideas, which were themselves informed by Reid's
knowledge and experience of cycling.
