This file explains how to regenerate the PNGs in this directory from the
corresponding ODG (openoffice) documents.

Note: Some of these documents have a change scheduled which may vary from
releases and other developments, so don't check them into SVN (the templates
are in SVN). They are the ones named -template.

To generate foo.png:

1. Copy foo-template.odg to foo.odg (if needed).
2. oodraw foo.odg &
3. Export the document as PNG, creating foo.png.
4. fixperms --public
