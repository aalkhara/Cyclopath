MnDOT staff developed this extension.  It is a tool for automating the bikeways creation procedure.  Bikeways were digitized using two methods:  a) bikeways identified on the MBN (or city or county-supplied maps) were digitized by selecting the road centerline and the Bikeways extension entered it into the database;  b)  heads-up digitization was employed when a bikeway did not follow a road centerline.  Background aerial photography was used to place the bikeway alignment as close to the source data as possible. <br> <br>Bikeways were located on the most current version of MnDOT road centerlines and converted in a separate layer using the MnDOT Bikeway mapping tool. Each line segment was coded to reflect the bikeway classification type, its position in relation to the road, if known, and the source of information. <br> <br>Primarily existing bikeways were entered during this phase. <br> <br>Phase 3 <br>In 2004 digitization continued in the manner described above, with 'proposed' bikeways being entered in addition to 'existing'. <br> <br>Phase 4 <br>The Land Management Information Center updated the data set for the following cities, townships and county:  Albertville, Brooklyn Park, Buffalo, Burns Township, Deephaven, Edina, Excelsior, Medicine Lake, Monticello, Mounds View, Oakdale, Vadnais Heights, White Bear Township, Washington County and Woodbury. <br> <br>Phase 5 <br> <br>In late 2006, LMIC updated the dataset. Cities added or updated: Clearwater, Corcoran, Delano, Hastings, Hugo, Minneapolis, Otsego, Rockford, St. Louis Park, St. Michael, St. Paul, Wayzata, Three Rivers District. <br> <br>Phase 6 <br> <br>In early 2007, Minneapolis and Ramsey County data were updated.  <br> <br>Source Materials: <br> <br>1. Bikeways locations and attributes came from the cities and townships. For Brooklyn Park, Eden Prairie and Woodbury, the source data was submitted as shapefiles; for the remaining updated areas, the source data was submitted as printed maps or PDFs. The date that the map was received from each city or township is recorded in the DATE attribute. <br> <br>2. Farm Service Agency natural color, 1-meter air photos, summer 2003, were available for the entire 9-county area. <br><a href=http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse/airphoto_usda.html#fsa target="_blank"> http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse/airphoto_usda.html#fsa</a> <br> <br>3. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency natural color, 0.3-meter air photos, spring 2004, were available for the St. Paul/Minneapolis city area. <br><a href=http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse/airphoto_usgs.html#high-res target="_blank"> http://www.lmic.state.mn.us/chouse/airphoto_usgs.html#high-res</a> <br> <br>4. Communities that responded to 4/8/05 request for information. <br> <br>Anoka County: <br>Burns Township - PDF <br> <br>Hennepin County: <br>Brooklyn Park - Shapefile <br>Deephaven - Paper map <br>Eden Prairie -Shapefile <br>Edina - Paper map <br>Excelsior  <br>Medicine Lake - Paper map <br> <br>Ramsey County: <br>Mounds View - Paper map <br>Vadnais Heights - PDF <br>White Bear Township - Paper map <br> <br>Washington County: <br>Oakdale - PDF <br>Woodbury - Shapefile <br> <br>Wright County: <br>Albertville - Paper map <br>Buffalo - DWG  <br>Cokato  <br>Monticello - Paper map <br>South Haven - No bikeways <br> <br>5. Bikeways in all updated cities, except St. Paul, were added by digitizing from a map submitted in PDF form. St. Paul submitted a bikeways shapefile. Aerial Photos (2004 National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) 1 foot and 2003 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) 1 meter images) were used as references.  <br> <br>6. Minneapolis and Ramsey County submitted shapefiles which were transferred into the existing bikeways dataset. Data and attributes were verified.  <br> <br>The addition of Ramsey County data corrupted some planned/proposed St. Paul bikeways. Metropolitan Council staff verified segments within St. Paul against existing and planned St. Paul bikeways files from 2006. Data is correct as of April 2007.  <br> <br>Processing Steps: <br> <br>Shapefiles: All the arcs that were not already included in the Bikeways data set were copied and pasted into the data set. The lines were not altered, however, NGA air photos were used to determine whether the trails were paved or unpaved if that attribute was not specified in the submitted shapefile. <br> <br>Maps:  Printed maps were scanned and georectified using ArcGIS software. Bikeways were then digitized using air photos (either FSA 2003 or NGA 2004); if a bikeway was not visible on the photos (usually in the case of proposed trails), then the line was digitized from the georeferenced map image. Trails along roadways follow MnDOT road line segments; the Trace tool was used to follow the segments exactly. <br> <br>Near the end of the project, the data was converted from shapefiles to an ArcGIS 8.3 geodatabase with constrained picklists in order to standardize entry of many of the attributes. </font></td>
