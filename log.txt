Bugfix to commit:

  new item row was being rewritted but value_text was
  being quoted twice in Python, so the column value was
  being quoted in the database.

Bugfix to commit command:
- When splitting byways, commit makes a bunch of client IDs,
  in addition to those sent by flashclient. But flashclient
  might be using client IDs it did not send to the server;
  i.e., both pyserver and flashclient may be using the same-
  valued client IDs for different item.
  - When returning the commit response, do not include server-
    side client IDs that the flashclient did not send, or
    flashclient will try to consume the commit response for
    items it did not transmit.

Fixes to Search for geocoding:
- Be a little more helpful when deciding to auto-select an
  address or whether to ask the user to choose. E.g.,
  'behind bars' doesn't quite match 'Behind Bars Bicycle Shop',
  but it's a lot better match than any that come after it.
- Since Levenshtein only computes the edit distance, we now also
  factor in the ts_rank, which counts the number of matching words.
  E.g., 'bars behind' should also rank the Behind Bars match high,
  and possibly to even auto-choose it for the user.
- We were also returning duplicate results when the search hit
  for different reasons, e.g., if the search matches the name of
  an item but also matches an annotation attached to the item,
  we'd return the item twice. I added a DISTINCT ON stack ID to
  fix this.

Flashclient bugfix frenzy:
- I analyzed log_event_check.sh output
  (of the log_event_joined table) and I
  changed active hard asserts into soft
  asserts, and I added more date logging
  for all asserts.
  - There are at least a few dozen active
    asserts in flashclient. I think I
    identified a few as false positives,
    but the rest I'm still very curious
    about.
  - The soft asserts are okay, generally,
    since the user won't notice them firing,
    but the hard asserts are worrying, as
    they'll probably send the client to an
    unknown, bad state. So I made the hards
    into softs, and I added traces to alls,
    although I was only able so far to nix
    two of them; the rest will be fixed
    when we gather more (crash) data...

Fixes to user__token code:
- Don't bother locking table before SELECT FOR UPDATE;
  just do a SELECT and then the FOR UPDATE second.
  Hopefully this'll fix the problem not being able
  to lock the user__token table when the server is
  very busy.
- Instead of failing without the user__token table
  row lock, if we at least know the token exists
  and matches, we can assume the user is verified.
  We just won't update usage_count in user__token
  which isn't a super huge deal.
- Make better use of db.quoted() and double-check
  username after verifying password (which scrubs
  quotes) but before setting command.username (which
  was just copying the un-escaped username). So
  to make doubly-sure no one is trying any SQL
  injection.
- Catch malformed token error, rather than creating
  crash dump. The token should only be malformed if
  the user hacks their GWIS, but we have hacked GWIS
  for testing, so let's not just crash pyserver.

TileCache wrapper script fixes:
- When rebuilding cluster, commit every iteration,
  rather than just at the end (hours later), and
  call sleep each iteration, otherwise the live
  Cyclopath production server gets blocked! That
  is, no one can request routes, etc., while
  tilecache is rebuilding the cache unless we
  are more proactive about not running hot...
  which is really annoying and means our 24 cores
  in the production server are kinda useless.
- Fix problem cloning the db connection and not
  just making a new connection -- with the clone,
  we're getting the cannot-commit-with-multiple-cursors-open
  error.
- Before running tile update code, check not just
  rebuilding zooms cache (in which case do not run
  the update-to-revision code).

Fix search-for and geocode-of queries using all feature-specific stop words.
- Our code was asserting on an unexpected empty query string.
- The problem is that we scrub for stop words a few times, and
  sometimes we scrubbed all the search terms in a later pass.
  - We look for stop words twice:
    - Once when we look for generic, e.g., English, stop words
      (like "a", "and", "the", etc.) using the built-in Postgres
      stop-word-finder-outer;
    - and a second time, when we look for specific, Cyclopath-y stop
      words. These are words used in the names of 200 or more (or so)
      features. E.g., "St" and "Ave" are stop words for byway
      (line segment) features because so many such features' names
      include these words.
  - It was after the second stop word scrub that code was finding
    a null query. This fix is to try to find an '&' of the raw query
    words, stops words or not.
    - E.g., each of the words in the query, "Pine Point Park", is a byway stop
      word, so don't search for "pine" or "point" or "park" (because you'd get
      one thousand meaningless results) but at least look for "pine" and "point"
      and "park" in the feature name.
    - [lb] is aware that this issue is not completely resolved... this fix
      addresses what's called a "corner case", i.e., users will always
      enter input we (developers) didn't anticipate, so don't expect
      that search and geocode are completely fixed. I think maybe we went from
      94% to 95% awesomeness.

Bugfixes to shapefile import:
- Allow fixed features to still have 'noring' guidance and still be imported properly
  (so you don't have to split a ring and also update its two features' attributes).
- Change pprint.pprint to pprint.pformat to fix log file problems
  (the former prints to stdout, whereas we just want a basestring).
- Go back to ignoring 'everylayer.*' (and fix reasons for that hack).

Lots of Shapefile import script fixes:
- Add --revision-user switch so the revision can
  that an anonymous user did all the work.
- Allow Shapefile to be '3D LineString' in addition
  to 'LineString' (since we ignore the z, anyway).
- Deprecate setting of the is_disconnected attribute
  and tag, since the planner now manages this value
  (also, if we do it during the import, we invariably
  mark most items dirty and end up touching way more
  items than we intend to touch).
- Fix problem discerning target Shapefile layer from
  gfl_typish input.
- Fix issue treating LineStrings as MultiPolygons...
- Be sure to set a default for byway.z.
- Fix problem saving string-type link_values' values
  as integer-type.
- Clear item_revisionless edited_* attributes when
  updating existing items (the edited_* attributes
  can be loaded from the revision table if they're
  not in item_revisionless, and we don't want to
  accidentally save the revision values to item_-
  revisionless).

Big bugfix: Route requests blocked by update.
- When a user saves the map, the route planner has to update
  its network graph. During the update, in tight for and while
  loops, the Python interpreter doesn't swap threads, so the
  update blocks route requests for ten minutes.
  - One solution (implemented here) is to call
      time.sleep(0.001) every iteration to force
      the interpreter to swap threads.
  - A better solution (BUG nnnn) might be to use a mutex
    and to block the update thread whenever it detects
    that a route request is being processed.

Fixes to recent changes to route-finder:
The networkx library doesn't support astar on a "mutli"

we discard all but one of any set of parallel roads, which
is a problem we'll have to solve on another day (i.e., if a
bike path and a road share the same endpoints, one of them
will be discarded when we construct the road network and
won't be used by/known to the route planner).

Major bugfix: disconnected subtrees still causing a problem finding routes.
- Now when the p3 route finder loads, it finds the well-connected subtree
  and then examines all byways in the database and fixes is_disconnected.
- Switching from simple networkx.DiGraph to MultiDiGraph, which
  allows for two or more lines going the same direction sharing
  the same nodes (to avoid accidentally clobbering the edge when,
  e.g., just one of the byways is wiki-deleted.

Bugfixes to item panels for handling old item versions.
- We need to handle old item versions so that Routes (and other
  item_revisionless items) have a verifiable audit trail, and
  so they can be reverted. (Otherwise it's impossible to tell
  who edited the item and when.)
  - Also, until the revision revert command is fixed, this is
    at least another way to fix bad edits.
  - It's also nice to see all edits done on a specific item
    without having to dink around the revision history widget.

Geofeature class updates:

    in-appearance, cut-n-pasted but long-since-deviated
    copies of the mobr_dr() fcn. Now there's just one
    implementation, in Geometry.
- Add version_history_filter boolean, to indicate if
  we should draw old versions of items. It's generally
  toggled by the user via a Show/Hide button in the
  item version history explorer widget.
  - Relatedly, don't setup mouse listeners on old versions
    of items, and don't indicate is_clickable for same.

      on mouse events for old route versions' sprites, and indicating

  - The master_route is probably redundant; see: item_stack.master_item.

Lots of fixes to Geocoding.
Highlights:
- Calculate and return a confidence value for each result.
- Also tell the client which geocoder generated which result.
- The command is more liberal about including results, and
  being so quick to exclude results.
- Added a geocoder driver for the MapQuest service.

Regarding the confidence calculation:
- For external results, we had not been doing this, and for
  internal results, we had been using psql full text ts_rank.
  - But ts_rank does not produce a useful value, both because of how
    it calculates the value, and also because of the short, structured
    nature of geocode queries.
    - I.e., geocode queries are a address (like street, city, state)
      or the name of a place (which is generally just a few words),
      whereas full text ts_rank is more useful for comparing
      longer texts, and it ranks results based on word frequencies
      of a given language... which makes it really hard to get it
      to work well for us.
   - Now we use the levenshtein distance and use a few other tricks
     to sort results better.

Regarding returning more results:
- Previously, a search for, e.g., "Fountain", would just
  return the point, "Fountain, MN", and would not bother
  sending anything else, such as "Gateway Fountain", or
  all of the "drinking fountain" points.

Regarding the MapQuest geocoder driver:
- The Bing service was offline for an extended amount of time,
  and we do not have another backup external geocoder.
- We will try using MapQuest service first (there is no daily limit
  on requests) and we will try Bing if MapQuest does not return any
  results (Bing limits to some number of 1,000s of requests/day).
- Also added a fcn. to normalize intersection queries: some
  services use "addy 1 and addy 2", while others use, e.g.,
  "addy 1 & addy 2" or even "addy 1 @ addy 2".

* Also, add user hint about hitting Find Route to complete the route
  request, after adjusting Biking Preferences (we could just auto-
  route find after the user hits Choose in the Address Resolver,
  but we only do that if the user had previously hit Find Route,
  otherwise we should not assume that they have seen Biking
  Preferences yet).

Alert user when committing map changes but not all endpoints
connect to the road network.
- I found that some users don't connect their new roadways,
  e.g., in the north metro, one user added a trail parallel
  to the road, but the trail was split into many pieces, none
  of which attached to the existing network. E.g., one line would
  start 5 meters from an intersection and continue until 5 meters
  before the closest driveway, and then a new line segment would start
  5 meters after the driveway, etc.... while this might look pretty,
  each of these line segments is a useless, non-routeable single line
  subtree.

Bugfix: When not throbbering, be sure not to suppress
similar error messages for distinct user actions (e.g.,
when one View History fails and we alert the user of
the server problem, if the user tries View History again,
we should be sure to show them the alert again, since
the user deliberately ran the command again (normally,
we suppress duplicate error messages, but this only
makes sense when throbbering, which means we're sending
many commands and we don't want to overwhelm the user
with redundant error messages, e.g., otherwise the
user might have to close dozens of modal alert dialogs
that all say the same thing)).

Work-around to old, unidentifed route bug:
* I think this happened when you dragged a route stop
  that was either the first or last stop, and then added
  a geocoded, intermediate stop: the node stack ID of the
  intermediate route stop does not match the node stack IDs
  of the incoming and outgoing byway edges.
  * This causes problems drawing and editing the route.
    For one, there's a weird, straight line drawn after
    the intermediate stop because it looks like a byway
    step is missing.
    Secondly, editing doesn't work or throws errors
    because the stop_step_number is not set for the
    intermediate stop with the problem.
* The work-around is to check each route stop on checkout
  and guess a stop_step_number for the route stops with
  problems.

Item History feature:
* Mostly to re-implement a way for people to view
  and revert to old versions of routes, which you used
  to be able to do if you knew enough to look in the
  Revision History (Recent [Map] Changes) list.
  * The new implementation is easier to find and use, and
    it intergrates with both the item details panel as an
    inline widget, and also with the route details panel,
    as a new tab that appears if the user clicks the new
    View History button.
  * Also to help with Landmarks, so we can always checkout
    the same versions of routes used in the experiment.
* Ability to revert an individual item to a specific version.
  In CcpV1, you could do this by reverting the revision when
  the route was saved, but routes are now revisionless, so
  reverted the revision no longer works.
  * And reverting a route by reverting a revision through Recent
    Changes doesn't seem like the right model. The Recent Changes
    list should just be about map items. You can go to the Route
    Library to see a list of recent changes to routes (it's
    already ordered by what was recently edited), and you can go
    to the Discussions panel to see a list of threads ordered
    by edited_date, so why should we mix routes and map changes?
    They're different, so having the revert-route action something
    you do from the route details panel seems like the right model.

Modify GWIS_Route_Get_Saved's constructor's argument list.
* Add compute_landmarks, so callers can specify if they
  want the server to spend extra time looking for landmarks.
* Add callback_fail parameter, so callers can actually do
  something if, e.g., the route finder is not running,
  otherwise we'd end up in an unknown state, e.g.,
  spinners endlessly spinning and UI components disabled
  when they should be re-enabled, etc.
Landmarks bugfix: Use route system_id when fetching routes

  indicates if we've fetched landmarks for the route,

Landmarks bugfix: Replace route stack IDs with system_ids.
* The problem was using just the stack_id without a version.
  * We were always using the Current version of the route,

    working on the wrong version of the route.
* I added one set of system IDs to conf and removed duplicate
  sets of stack_ids from two different command modules
  (DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself).
* Rename some 'r' and 'rt' variables to 'sys_id', because we use
  'rt' for route objects, usually, and we should have the code
  indicate the variable is an integer instead.

  users could still hack away (custom GWIS; never happened)
  and be able to view historic versions of an item (read:
  routes). This was by design, and if you've already shared
  something, one could argue that it's forever shared, but
  we shouldn't play like that. If someone wants to deny a
  user access to something -- be it a route, or maybe a
  branch -- they should be able to deny access for all time,
  past and present.

   permissions. We no longer allow users to see items
   they *used* to be able to access.
   * Not that we really ever exposed this feature in
     a client anywhere, but it was the model the wiki
     was following, and it just doesn't make sense --
     it's confusing to understand and difficult to code,
     so best just to say that, even if a user had access
     to an item, or if a user is looking at a version of
     an item from a point in time when that user did not
     have access to that item, they can still access it
     because of their Current permissions.

Changes to item_revisionless and item_versioned and item_stack:
* creator_name is no longer stored in item_stack, but is now
  grabbed from revision.username or item_revisionless.edited_user.
* Add created_date so the client can display, e.g., when an item
  was created, in addition to when it was last edited.
* Move qb.filters.filter_by_username here, alongside what smells
  like its duplicate, qb.filters.filter_by_creator_include.

Oi, more of the Recent Database Bugfixes:
* Put the ALTER TABLEs into temporary plpgsql functions
  so we can quickly re-run the upgrade script as we're
  developing (i.e., no need to lose an hour because we
  have to reload a test database).
* Bugfix: Add GIA records for 71 tracks missing 'em.
  Because they were anonymously-requested and never
  assigned an owner, and the CcpV1->V2 upgrade script
  missed that.
* Bugfix: Two watch_regions were neglected during
  CcpV1->V2 upgrade because of some unknown problem;
  reparied them (from version=0 to v=1, and added GIA
  record).
* Rename the recently added (but not yet released)
  item_revisionless columns to better reflect their
  association (by renaming with a common prefix) and
  also to conform to other common usages in the code.
* Don't set edited_user and edited_date for items
  where that information is available in the revision
  table... this saves space (is that important?),
  and forces one to better understand how revisioned
  and revisionless items differ (the former's edited
  user and date are the same as the revision's, and
  the latter's are stored in item_revisionless).
* Add track to the item_revisionless mix, like route.
* Rename a few other deprecated columns we should later
  delete.

Bugfix to maint.sh.
* Backstory: The East Bank lost power this morning
  and our server was powered off for a while and then
  rebooted. On reboot, it started multiple route
  finders, i.e., for the 'live' site and also 'sib1'
  or 'sib2' (one of those services had a typo in its
  init.d script, so it wasn't enabled). But the apache2
  configuration was using the 'sib1' or 'sib2' site, so,
  after killing the extraneous finders, the site was unable
  to find the route daemon because the PID file name was
  being incorrectly computed, i.e., using the wrong
  instance name, e.g., minnesota___cycloplan_sib1 and not
  minnesota___cycloplan_live.
* The solution is to call "update-rc.d" and disable the
  old site and enable the new site when switching from
  'sib1' to 'sib2', rather than relying on the generic
  'live' site config.
** I've also fixed the instructions in the file to
   include the `update-rc.d ... disable` command.

Database bugfixes:
------------------
* Landmarks: Need route version or to use system_id.
** One of the routes in the experiment was edited,
   so some subjects worked with a different route
   than other subjects (though I only saw two such
   cases in the data).
------------------
* Route Steps: Missing names and System IDs.
** There's a bug when saving later versions
   of routes: the name and sometimes system ID
   isn't recorded.
** Add branch_id column to help recreate system ID.
------------------
* Group_Item_Access: The same system ID shared between
                     different versions of an item.
** I.e., the v=1 and v=2 of an item both have the
         same system ID.
** Problem happened to items that were marked deleted
   when we ran the CcpV1->V2 upgrade scripts last Fall,
   so the problem may not have had an ill effect (since
   we never noticed any problem related to it in the client
   or pyserver).
------------------
* Group_Item_Access: Missing rows for link_values to
  watch_region comments from CcpV1 that were converted
  to annotations in CcpV2.
** As a result, if you have a note on a watch_region on the
   old server, you'll now notice that note reappear on the
   new server.
------------------
* Routes: Add GIA records for routes "missing" GIA rows.
** Summary (see sql file for full comments and examples):
   CcpV1 clones routes when changing permissions, and when
   auto-updating broken routes (which happens, it seems,
   whenever a route is viewed) so, in our data, it looks
   like there are 100,000s of unique routes when they might
   just be 10,000s.
*** However, during the CcpV1 upgrade, some of the v=1 and
    valid_start_rid=0 anonymous routes that were later
    cloned don't have GIA records, but all new routes
    requested at least have a Session ID GIA record, so
    we should backfill these missing records.
*** I seem to remember one summer that we touted our
    popularity by citing a spike in route requests,
    but if that number was based on unique route IDs...
    then it was probably caused by the new route code
    behavior, and not really an increase in usership.    
*** Not a super big deal but if you're poking around the
    data and come across this problem, you might investigate
    it before realizing it's not a big deal. So to prevent
    future wastes of time investigating this problem, fix it.
*** Patching the missing GIA records also ensures that the
    new item_revisionless table includes all existing items.
------------------
* Item_Revisionless: Add new, intermediate table.
** Move acl_grouping from group_item_access to item_revisionless.
** This fixes an issue showing an accurate edit history for
   non-revisioned items, like routes and work_items, which
   begin life (version=1) at one of the special epoch revisions,
   rev=0 or rev=1. That is, for normal, revisioned map items,
   we can join on revision for the editor username, etc., and
   now we have an appropriate place to store similar data for
   non-revisioned items.
** It also lets us let users add checkin comments to routes
   and other revisionless items.
------------------
* Link_Values: I found three rows in the database where lhs_stack_id = 0.
** I deleted the rows. I checked CcpV1 and the problems exists there, too.
   It looks like cruft from an orphan-saving problem, e.g., user creates
   new byway in client and creates new link_value, deletes byway, and saves.
   The CcpV2 code does a better job not committing orphans (and also not
   having the client send 'em to begin with), so we're okay deleting these.
------------------
* Link_Values: Delete other orphaned link_values.
** There are over one hundred links in CcpV1 that don't reference valid items,
   so we can delete those rows from CcpV2.
*** We also delete item_versioned rows for deleted byways from CcpV1 that
    were not properly imported into CcpV2: they are missing their geofeature
    row. And it's easier to delete these rows than to fix them (and they
    don't really cause a problem, anyway: the valid_until_rid is set on
    the last version of the non-deleted byway... so we could always repair
    these items in the future by looking for items whose latest valid_until_rid
    is not the infinite revision; but leaving them in the database does no harm).
------------------
* Route_Parameters: Recreate rows missing from CcpV1.
** In CcpV1, not all routes have a route_priority row, but this means we have
   to, e.g., be sure to outer join and not inner join, among other things, so
   it's better to recreate these rows and then we don't have to worry about them
   being missing.
------------------
Off topic:
* Rename 'wgt_personalized_f' to 'wgt_pers_f' to better match other route
  planner weight names (all others are 10 character names, for one).

Route Stop List fixes:
- Previously, if a user dragged a route stop to reorder
  them, all unnamed route stops were deleted.
  - What a horrible behavior. It's fixed now so that
    reordering the route stop list doesn't add or remove
    stops.
- Fixed problems setting route stops dirty to determine
  which route segments to re-request.
  - Fortunately, a user made a Grand Rounds route with two
    named stops and a dozen unnamed stops that's made it
    easy for me to test and fix route stop editing...

Route_Stop updates:
- New fcn., is_stop_worthy, to indicate if a route stop
  should appear in the route stop list.
  - The new fcn. allows selected, unnamed routes to
    appear in the list.
    - This enables new functionality previously unavailable,
      e.g., now users can select two or more unnamed stops so
      they show up in the list, and then the user can drag the
      unnamed stops to new positions in the route manifest.
- Bugfix: Don't clear route stop dirty on mouse up, but leave
  it, so that the route is updated (otherwise dragging a route
  stop doesn't have any effect).
- Bugfix: After entering a geocode address and getting a
  confident result, we weren't kicking off the route
  request or restitching the route.

Bugfix to Route_Stop_Entry:
- When showing or hiding the address resolver widget,
  be sure to signal the parent to update its container
  height, otherwise the resolver widget is clipped by
  later route stops in the list, and not all route stops
  fit in the list.

Route Save Footer bugfixes:
- If user edits a route and then undos all commands on the
  stack, editing the route again would not re-enable
  the Undo button.
- The route save footer is hidden when not needed, but
  there were some times that trying to show it failed,
  because of how we were calculating the height.
  - Rather than use the callLater hack and hope that
    the height is correct in the callback, use a
    ChangeWatcher instead and get notified in the
    same frame as the change to the widget's height.
- On Undo and Reset (applied to the route editing
  command stack), disable route stop editing, otherwise
  we might accidentally leave the add-stop tool active
  even though the user performed an action that should
  have reset it.

Let user select multiple route stops and delete them en bulk.
- If we force the user to delete one route stop at a time,
  we'll end up route-requesting and stitching every time we
  remove a route stop, so the bulk operation is quicker,
  cleaner, and easier for the user.
- Update the Add Destination handler so we can call it to
  disable it when we're disabling route stop editing,
  otherwise the "Cancel" text remains, even though we've
  already left the add-route-stop mode.
- Hide the Delete Selected Destination(s) button when too
  many route stops are selected to be able to delete them
  all and not obliterate the route line.

Bugfix: When clicking a route stop and dragging, if
the user drags fast and releases the mouse while
dragging, the mouse up event target is *not* the
route stop.
- So Route_Stop doesn't get the event and we don't
  update the route.
- Now we check if there's a drag in progress and
  then send the mouse up from the map mouse handler,
  since we know the route stop handler won't get
  the event otherwise.

Bugfix: When zooming in or out, update the advanced tool
palette icons (e.g., enable Create Byway if zooming in to
vector, or disable it if zooming out to raster).
- Also, switch to the pan/select tool -- that is, zooming
  cancels the current tool mode.
  - This is easier than the alternative, which is to
    check what tool is active and to see if it can
    still be active in the next zoom level, but that
    approach would mean that sometimes zooming would
    reset the tool, and sometimes it wouldn't. So let's
    be consistent and always reset the tool on zoom.

Route class updates:
- In Route, keep track of how many route stops are selected
  so we can disable or hide the Delete Selected Destinations
  button when the user selects more stops than can be deleted
  (otherwise we might reduce the route to a point or nothing).
- Also, switch back to the pan/select tool when disabling
  route stop editing, otherwise we might leave the tool in
  the add-new-stop state, even though we reverted the widget
  to the non-add-new-stop state (so when the user clicks the
  map next, we add a new route stop, even though we should've
  left that mode).
- Fix it so you can delete unnamed route stops, too, and not
  just named route stops.

Don't log server errors back to the server.
- E.g., if GWIS_Geocode fails and the server sends GWIS_Error

  server. Silly, right?

Add two new classes to replace two annoying Objects
that were added long ago for route editing.
- New classes: Route_Stop_Editor and Route_Segment.
- The route editing code had just been using generic
  Objects, but this is so bad:
  - There's no typing. When I converted to a strongly-
    typed class, I found places where we were treating
    an attribute as a String and other places that treated
    it as a Number. Now the compiler can catch errors
    like that.
  - Flex can't tell if you refer to an attribute using
    the wrong attribute name, because Flex doesn't
    care. It'll return null if you access an attribute
    by the wrong name, and your code might not realize
    anything is wrong.
  - Using an Object, it's hard for a developer to determine
    what the attributes are. Now, you can just look at the
    class definition to understand what's in the object,
    and what the object does.

Tons of Route Editing bugfixes.
- "Tons of Route Editing bugfixes"; from CcpV1:
  - Bugfix: When a user edits a route and tries to
    reorder one of the route stops, flashclient deletes
    all of the other unnamed route stops.
    - E.g., consider the route, Grand Rounds, Stk. 1596642,
      with one named start destination, another named
      end destination, and a dozen intermediate stops along
      the way. The user indicated the start and end by typing
      addresses, and then s/he indicated the intermediate
      stops by clicking and dragging the route (at least
      that's what I'm assuming for this discussion).
      - Before saving, or after saving, (either way,
        hypothetically, had the user did/done this, or maybe
        they had, and then they hit Undo), if the user tried
        to add a route stop using the other method -- not by
        clicking and dragging the route line, but by using
        the "Add Destination" feature on the panel and then
        entering a new address in the input text field --
        flashclient would mess up and delete all unnamed
        route stops.
    - You could also inadvertently delete multiple route
      stops just by deleting one route stop from the list,
      e.g., if there are three named stops in the list but
      additional, unnamed stops on the map, then deleting a
      named stop from the list would also (bugfully) delete
      all adjacent unnamed stops.
      - Similar things happened when trying to reorder the
        route stop list when unnamed route stops also existed.
  - In CcpV1, there is a lot of duplicate code because
    the route stops and their associated geocode commands
    are handled separately by the route list widget and by
    the find new route widget.
    - I combined all duplicate code and made special classes
      to handle geocoding.
      - DRY, DRY, DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself. Oops!
    - I got rid of the modal, obtrusive, so-called ambiguous
      results resolver and moved the geocode results inline.
      - In CcpV1, the user is interupted when a geocode
        command returns more than one result. The user is
        forced to make a decision then and there, and they're
        not given all of the information they could use.
        - This is rather annoying, especially since Cyclopath
          is a map, but by using a modal dialog, there's no
          way for the user to see the results on the map.
      - Now, in CcpV2, we list a few geocode results below the
        search box where the user entered the address query, and
        the user can click "Locate" to see each result on the map.
        - I also added a pageinator, so the user can peruse a
          complete list of results (in CcpV1, the server only
          returned the first five results; now, we can let the
          user browse all results using said great paginator)).
  - I fixed problems with multiple click and double-click
      handlers handling the same route stop and route events.
    - I added more calls to stopPropagation, and to resetting
      the double-click detector, and to not process a mouse
      event without making sure another callback hasn't already
                                                 hadndled it.
  - In CcpV1, geocode and route-stop routing errors from the
    server were neither processed nor even hooked, so the GUI
    could enter weird states and become useless. E.g., if a
    route segment failed to update, the temporary dashed lines
    wouldn't be removed from the map, the "Route Updating..."
    text wouldn't disappear, and the route would not be
    editable again (at least not without an application reboot).
  - After editing edit stops, update route stops on the map and
    in the route list on the route details panel, so they
    reflect current reality.
  - The temporary route stop sprite (drawn while the user is
    mousing over the route line) was not always removed from
    the map, e.g., when mousing from a route sprite to a
    route stop sprite, the change was not noticed and you'd see
    leftover artifacts.
- "Tons of Route Editing bugfixes"; for CcpV2:
  - Fix newish route editing feature, "Drag Route Line to Add Stops".
    - Was working backwards and not reliably.
  - Fix newish route editing feature, "Ignore Clicks".
    - Wasn't coordinating well with mouse up, mouse down, roll over
      and roll out events, among other things.
  - Clicking one route stop on the map would highlight all
    of that route stop's route's stops: Fixed.
  - Wrap calls to G.panel_mgr.panels_mark_dirty for route_panel
    so that we don't inadvertently create new panels after we just
    deleted them.
  - If an unnamed route stop is named 'Point on map', don't prefix it
    with 'Point near', as in, 'Point near Point on map'. Blech...ehheh.
- "Tons of Route Editing" modifications; changes from CcpV1 to CcpV2:
  - In the route list, I recently fixed it so that the *first* and *last*
    stops *always* show up in the list (in CcpV1, it's the first
    *named* stop and the last *named* stop that show up, i.e., the
    true beginning and the true finishing destination of the route might
    not be displayed).
    And then I enhanced it further:
    - When you click a route stop on the map, it's now highlighted
      specially (with a yellow highlight, to make it more obvious
      that the user selected it), and it's also highlighted in the
      route list widget in the route details panel, as well as on the map.
      - There's also a little note that says that a route stop is
        highlighted and that the user can delete it, either by
        pressing backspace (the hidden CcpV1 method; still supported)
        or by clicking the Remove Selected Destination button.
      - If the user clicks the route stop again on the map, it's deselected.
      - If the route stop is unnamed (also known as "pass-through"),
        it's now shown in the route stop list so that the user can
        name it, or at least more easily/intuitively remove it.
  - Users can now cancel a route stop drag operation by clicking Escape.
    - Users can also hit "Reset" or "Undo" while the geocode command is
      outstanding to cancel it. E.g., if a user accidentally starts editing
      a route, they can more easily backoutof/cancel what they were doing.
    - In CcpV1, you couldn't cancel route editing commands, and the
      undo and redo were mixed in with normal map item edits (ick!).
  - You can now rename route stops, whether named or unnamed.
    - In CcpV1, there are two hidden ways to deal with unnamed stops:
      You can click and drag them (but not reorder them), and you
      can click them and then press Backspace to delete them
      (but not simply rename/name them, or do anything else with them,
      especially since they generally disappeared once you edited the
      route, as described above).
      - Specifically, after clicking a stop (which the user doesn't
        necessarily know to do, since there's no documentation, anywhere,
        about this feature), the application won't specially highlight
        the stop nor will it inform the user that they can now delete
        the selected route stop by pressing a keyboard key.
        - In CcpV2, now, hopefully, it's more clear to users how to
          manipulate unnamed route stops.
      - Added context-sensitive help text saying that route stops can be
        clicked, renamed, moved, or removed, depending on application state.
      - When you click an unnamed route stop, it appears in the route
        stop list.
        - Users can reorder the unnamed route stop via the list, but clicking
          the stop on the map to select it, and then dragging its entry in
          the route stop list to reorder it.
        - Users can name the unnamed route stop, so that it'll always appear
          in the route list always, and not just on the map.
          - Note that in CcpV1, you couldn't rename or edit an unnamed route
            stop, and if you renamed a named route stop in the list, the
            client would send a geocode command and would move
            the route stop to a new location (and rename it).
            - I find this behavior nonintuitive and annoying. If I see an
              edit box with a name in it -- like I do all over Cyclopath --
              I assume that it means that I can edit the name -- nice and
              quick -- and that nothing else happens.
            - I think users have been surprised in the past that renaming
              a route stop really caused a geocoding and re-routing of their
              route, and that the new behavior will be a welcome adjustment.

  about 10 seconds on the server, and now it takes about

  - I replaced some JOINs against temporary tables of stack
    IDs with just WHEREing the stack IDs from those tables.
    This appears to work well. At least, three times weller.
- Also add confidence to gwis output so client can know if
  one geocoded result is because the server was very confident
  and truncated results, or if because server was not very
  confident and found only one result.

  and it only gets one result, it would assume that that
  result was perfect, but there was the possibility that
  the server hadn't truncated results to indicate a perfect
  result but had merely only found one result.
  - The new confidence attribute can be used to tell if
    a single geocoded result is probably what the user
    is seeking, or if the server only found one un-
    confident result.

- Rework the route_priority table and some route columns:
  - There was a disconnect in the model:
    - The route_priority table stores options used to create
      the route, so it should be (a) named more generically
      and (b) include columns from the route table that
      also only apply to when the route was created.
      - This is like the item_stack table: these are
        attributes that only apply to version=1 of an item.
    - I got rid of the 'priorities' array because it's confusing
      and was never implemented as maybe it was intended. It's
      always a dictionary of two keys, 'dist' and 'bike', whose
      values, when added, equal 1.0. So we only need to store
      one value (and I choose the bike priority value).
  - I moved all the planner options that are submitted with
    a new route request from the route table to the newly
    renamed route_priority table, route_parameters.
    - I also updated SQL and pyserver as appropriate.
  - These values are all returned to the client on route
    checkout, so that the client can recreate existing
    routes using the original planner parameters, and
    so that users looking at old routes can see how
    (with what settings) they were generated.
- Like the recently added pickle, flashclient_settings, I added
  a pickle for route finding options, routefinder_settings,
  so we can stop the insanity (no more having to add or alter
  database columns just to tweak route planner options).
BTW: I checked the android code and don't think any of
     my changes affect mobile... let's hope I'm right! =)

Bugfix (I think -- this one is hard to reproduce):
- Sometimes (three or four now it's happened) when you

  close some of them, eventually clicking on any of the
  Find Route tabs will cause the last route details panel
  to be activated. Anytime you try to change panels, the
  panel changes back to the route panel.
  - Like I side, this is hard to reproduce, so I'm hoping

Bug fix to updating Restricted-type items:
- In the Access Infer sent from the client,
  we were treating a missing value for a
  mask as setting that mask to denied.
  - So, e.g., when I tried to make a new
    route publically viewable, I ended up
    setting the route viewable for the public,
    but I also set my access to denied
    (so I lost access to the route).
  - The fix is to ignore the GIA record
    for an unset mask, and to just copy-
    forward the GIA record from the last
    version.

Fix the Route Repair feature.
- In CcpV1, first route stops and then route steps
  would be fetched, and then an additional query was
  made to look for byways that had been edited since
  the route was last saved, and then another query
  was made to see if the changes to the byways really
  affected the route, and finally any new route segments
  were computed and stiched into the route.
  - A number of issues with the CcpV1 implementation:
    - There was no way for user to opt out -- or even
      know that the feature was running -- and fetching
      a route from the library was taking longer that
      fetching a new route.
      - The pyserver code in CcpV1 is long, confusing,
        and makes multiple calls to the database to
        figure out if a route needs repairing, and
        the algorithm to stitch route segments
        reiterates over all the steps for each stop
        (rather than just walking the list once).
      - The new approach is to do just one pass of
        the route steps, and to keep track of the
        route stops as the steps are processed.
      - I simplified how we check for changes: rather
        than checking out byways and checking revision
        IDs, we can just join on the old byway when we
        get the route steps, and we can see if the
        node endpoint IDs or the one_way value have
        changed- that's all we need to know if a byway
        is no longer part of a route network subtree.
        - Furthermore, we can ignore other changes to
          the byway, like a change to the geofeature
          layer type, or a change to an attribute, like
          speed limit, etc., that don't affect whether
          the byway is still connected the same way.
      - In flashclient, we show a "Repair Route" button
        on the route details panel if a route should
        be recomputed.
Speed up get existing route (barely) by not fetching
  tags for non-personalized routes.

Awesome Useability Enhancements to finding routes.
- Background Geocoding!
  - Start geocoding before the user hits Find Route.
    - We can do it when the text edit box loses focus;
      We can also do it if the text edit box is changed
      and there's a second or two of inactivity.
      And if we really want to be Web Two Point Oh,
      we can even do it on Find Route button mouse
      over, in anticipation of the user clicking it.
    - If a destination geocodes confidently, we can
      show the little "x" box next to the address to
      indicate that we've geocoded the destination.
      - If the destination is ambiguous, we'll hold
        on to the search results and wait until the
        user hits Find Route, and then we can just
        pop up the Address Chooser right away (i.e.
        saving the user the wait between clicking
        Find Route and being asked to clarify the
        destination).
- Previously, it was only via Search Results that
  we'd show the Find Route panel with the label
  instead of the edit box and that we'd remember the
  geocoded coordinate.
  - Now we do that with pregeocoding, as described
    previously, and also via the route details panel,
    when someone engages Recreate Route Request.
    - In addition to the old "x" button to delete
      the geocoded destination, you can now click
      the label to start editing it. Once the user
      changes the destination text, we'll forget
      the previously geocoded coordinate.
- Ease off on the annoying "This field is required"
  pointer and red outline. Most people know how to
  request a route and if you just click in the "To"
  and then click elsewhere, you'll trigger the
  annoyance. And I don't like pushy controls; I
  think we can assume our users know a "to" and
  "from" address is required to find a route.
- Split geocoding the "to" and "from" into two
  asynchronous calls.
  - The server, pyserver, is Python, which is
    not truly multi-threaded, so by using two
    asynchronous requests we can conceivably
    take advantage of a second core to process
    our request, potentially cutting the time
    to geocode a pair of destinations by 50%.
- Since geocoding and route finding can take a
  while, I added ability to dismiss the modal
  "Working..." dialog so user doesn't have to
  twiddle their thumbs while flashclient spins
  and spins and spins.
  - I should probably test sending two overlapping
    route requests from the same client and see
    what happens... =).
Updates to Find_Route_Manager and Panel_Routes_New.
- The classes are intimately coupled. There's no
  fighing it. Each manpulates the others' attributes
  as though they were their own... we could combine
  the two classes but there's at least some separation
  of responsibility, at least... though it's blurred
  somewhat by the fixes and features in this revision.
- When using the 'rac' weight, restricting the sliders
  to reflect what's available on the server (which is
  far fewer slider combinations than were available
  in the client).
- In past, you could cancel in-progress route
  request, but cancelling while geocoding had
  no effect.
- Lots of little fixes and improvements. The old code
  needed a lot of cleaning up, and it appreciates the
  love.

Update module to according to other recent route
class changes, e.g., Route class now manages its
rstops deliberately, so other classes should no
longer manipulate the array directly; and a lot
of the new route finding fcns. accept the
which-input enum. to help figure out what data
applies to the "to" address and which to the "from" address.
- Also, GWIS_Geocode is now handled by update_supplemental,
  and we supply an error callback so we can
  cleanup popup dialogs if the request fails.

To the Route Details panel:
- If a route is not editable and there is
  not a route description, hide the route
  description (it's just a big empty space).
- Fix the hint that's displayed when user
  enters add-route-stop mode (it was not
  showing, and I clarified the message).
- Show link to re-fetching route and fixing
  geometry if any stale route steps detected
  (that is, if any byways were edited, the user
  can opt-in and deliberate ask that a route
  be regenerated, rather than it happening
  automatically).
  - This makes checking out routes faster,
    and it unhides the feature. In the past,
    we'd fix a route first and then alert
    the user, but we were often trying to
    fix unbroken routes, which was a waste
    of a user's time, and then there was no
    alert to explain why checking out the
    route took so long.
- Add toolTip including normalized edge
  cost value (a newish value sent from server).
- New feature, "Recreate Route Request", i.e.,
  we'll switch to the find new route panel,
  we'll auto-fill the "to" and "from", and
  we'll remember the x,y coordinates so we
  don't have to geocode but can run the
  route request immediately.
  - This is useful for users who want to
    re-run a route and try different route
    finder settings.
    - In the past, a user would have to
      re-type the "to" and "from" destination
      by hand, and then we'd waste there
      time even further by geocoding two
      destinations for which we already
      had coordinates.

Route Stop list fixes:
- For a locked route (a route that the user cannot
  edit), the click-to-drag-and-reorder route stops
  feature was reacting with the pointer finger cursor
  when the user moused over the route stop label
  (which is the colorful circle with the letter in it
  that's to the left of the destination name in the list).
  - Now, you still get the pointing finger, but
    if you click, the map will pan and zoom to
    the route stop (like how the cue sheet works).
- For editable routes, I made a similar modification
  to dragging route stop list entries: now there's a
  timer that's used, so if the user clicks and releases,
  we'll pan and zoom, but if the user clicks and holds,
  then we'll start the route list entry drag operation instead.

Route.as:
- Support new stale_steps attr. from server
  that indicates if a route's step-byways have
  been edited since the route was requested.
  - I'll be adding an option that allows user
    to choose if stale routes are recomputed,
    since the operation makes route checkout
    take longer.
- Fix calculation of number of destinations
  (route stops) to include the first and last
  route stop.
  - Old calculation was just considering
    !is_pass_through, but what if user clicked
    map to add the last route stop? Then it
    wouldn't show up in the route list, and
    it wasn't made special on the map.
  - Mark first and last route stop as is_endpoint,
    and manage route_stop list deliberately to
    keep value current (as well as the number
    of route stops number).
- Fix street_name fcn.
  - Use first or last route step if a node ID
    match cannot be found.
  - Precede such names with "Point near " or
    somesuch text to indicate that user clicked
    map to create route stop.
- Reorder code that processes similar attributes
  to process them in similar orders.
- Add newish route.avg_cost value from server.
- New redraw_all() to support custom route coloring.

  later when the route comes back, its panel will open.
  - In the past, we've just blocked the user from doing
    anything!

Add new route stop columns: internal_stack_id and external_result.
- Indicates if a route stop matched a Cyclopath item (like
  a region or waypoint (geocoding) or even a byway or
  perhaps terrain (via search)), or if a route stop matched
  an externally geocoded result, like an address.
  - There's a problem in flashclient with not displaying
    the first or last route stop of a route if it's considered
    is_pass_through, which is applied when a user clicks the
    map to add a route stop.
    - I saw this on a user's route; there were four route stops:
      the original first stop, a user added and unnamed second
      stop, the original second stop which became the third
      stop, and a user-added and unnamed fourth stop. The
      last stop did not show up in the route stop list and was
      not shown on the map as an important destination, and
      the name of the route was wrong because it indicated
      that the route ended at the second-to-last stop.
Bugfixes to Route_Stop in flashclient, in addition to previous:
- Fix getting the street_name for a route stop that's not named.
  - If the stop is the first or last stop, try the name of the
    first or last step.
  - Since we walk the list of steps looking for node ID
    matches, we now cache the street name, so we're not
    always walking the list for information that doesn't
    change very often.
  - If user was using a map tool that shows the pointing
    finger cursor (like add byway, add waypoint, add route
    destination, etc.), if user moused over route stop, on
    mouse out, route stop would change cursor back to
    arrow cursor.
  - Support for user-customizable route color.
  - New fcn., lookat_rstop, supports zoom-and-pan to route
    stop, like we do for route directions (which is
    pan-and-zoom to route step).

    sent from _a_client_! We shouldn't trust the

Planner p3 Updates:
- New cli opt., shp_cache_dir, so you can specify the
  source Zipfile and the shapefile cache directory,
  instead of also specifying the shapefile path
  itself.
  - The planner walks the Zipfile so it can figure
    out what the Shapefile name and path to it.
  - On startup, the planner checks a touch file
    and only bothers unpacking the Zipfile if it's
    changed.
  - We can now point the planner at the nightly
    export shapefile that's generated, so it'll
    always be current when it's restarted.
- Fix for route analysis: p3 planner can now
  boot from the database rather than a shapefile,
  so the planner can now be used for historical
  analysis.
- Add some lookups for which subset of 'rac'
  weights to precompute, since we shouldn't
  really be wasting our memory computing them all
  (we were computing len('rat')*len('fac') of them,
  which is too many, especially for a weight whose
  utility is suspect or superfluous).

Route List fixes (mostly to the route list on the
recent routes panel, and not to the route list on
the route library panel).
- For logged in users, fix the remove-routes-from-list
  buttons. The Remove All Checked, Remove All Unchecked,
  and Remove All All variations weren't working
  solidly.
  - The remove all checked button removed all routes
    from the user's library.
  - The buttons were not changing their labels to
    match the length of the list, and the buttons were
    not enabling and disabling corrrectly.
  - The pageinator wasn't staying current as routes
    were removed and added, and sometimes we'd show
    the empty-history message when we just needed to
    reload a page of routes.
- For logged out users, we weren't managing the list
  of routes so that the pageinator could be used.
  - Now the list just grows and grows and an
    anonymous user will always just see one ever-growing
    page of routes.
  - When the user logs on, we now send findability
    requests for all the routes they viewed anonymously,
    so that we're not removing routes from the recently
    viewed list but adding them to the user's history.
- Add a confirmation when removing routes from the
  history, since the operation is undoable.

Fix route stop editing:
- Clicking "Add Destination" didn't change the button:
  It should read "Cancel" because the mouse tool changes
  to the add-route_stop tool.
  - Since it's not really obvious that the tool activates,
    we not display a hint telling the user they can click the
    map to add the stop, or they can type it in the editbox.
- We were checking !travel_mode to see if a route was editable.
  Really, it's travel_mode != transit that means a route is
  editable (well, that, and if the user has permissions;
  we check != transit because our *code* doesn't support
  editing multimodal routes (i.e., it's not implemented)).

to the route itself, so that the route itself dispatches
the event.

- Fix problem on route request cleanup when adding additional
  route stops and there's a failure.
  - The GUI wasn't cleaning up, e.g., the panel would continue
    to read "Loading: 60%..." after the command failure was
    processed.
  - For whatever reason, the route segment request wasn't
    specifying an error handler... no wonder the widget was

(Also in previous checkin:)
New flashclient_settings user_ and preference column:
- Like the old preference columns, but we never have
  to add another column when preferences are added or
  renamed because flashclient pickles the data before
  pyserver stores it, so pyserver doesn't care/know
  anything about these preferences.
- On the map settings panel, users can now hit a
  "Remember Settings" button and however they've
  configured the settings on that panel will be
  restored the next time the user logs on.
  E.g., I like to start in editing mode, and
  maybe others always want to start with aerial
  tiles, well- now ya can!
- Fix the Check All and Check None Tag Filter
  Viewer buttons on the map settings panel.
- Also fix the Tag Filter Viewer widget:
  - We were going through item link_values
    looking for tags rather than going through
    the lightweight "tags" lookup.
    - The problem is that link_values are
      only lazy-loaded, so not all items in
      memory have link_values (in fact, most
      don't, until you start editing them).
    - So tag filters haven't been working for
      a long time... and now they're back!
  - Rename tag filter's update() to update_tags_list()
    to be more easily traceable.
New "user_event_changing" event.
- Until now, we've had a user_changed (after
  the fact event), so the changing event can
  be used to prepare for the change (e.g., on
  login, we want to submit findability requests
  for all the routes the user viewed while not
  logged in, so that whatever routes they've
  requested that session will still show up
  in their recently viewed route history).
Also new "g_initialized_event" that fires once
  G.user and G.map are ready.

- Fake set Route_Step.selected (now renamed rstop_selected, to make
  easier to trace):
  - On mouse_over of the route on the map, we would draw the
    row stop letters but not the colorful background circle.
  - Now when we fake-select the route to show it highlighted,
    we also fake-select the route stops.
- New route panel option: "Uncheck in route list on close"
  (it's not named as crudely in the client).
  - Previously, when you clicked "More" in the route list
    and the route panel was opened, the entry in the route
    list would have its checkbox selected, which means to
    show the route on the map, even the panel is closed.
    - This behavior is really confusing- if you close a
      route and its line is not removed from the map, it
      makes you think something is wrong.
    - Now there's a checkbox beneath the route list that's
      selected (enabled) by default that means the route
      will be removed from the map when its panel is closed.
      - So you can, e.g., select the checkbox of a route in
        the list and it'll draw on the map, then double-click
        the list entry or click "More" to open and switch to
        the route details panel, and then close the panel and
        the route is removed from the map and its checkbox
        in the route list is deselected/unchecked.
        - If a user prefers the old behavior, they'll (hopefully)
          see the new checkbox option beneath the route list.
- Fix click on static cue sheet direction header to do lookat-
  I just broke it!
- Fix the Remove All button beneath the route library route list:
  - The total count needs to be updated when the pageinator
    is updated, otherwise it says 0 items when they are many.
  - It and its neighbor button were also disabled at the
    wrong time.

Change map's items_add to return list of client-side items.
- First, rename init() to item_init() to make easier to
  trace usage.
- Second, assemble list of existing clientside items spliced
  with new items from server. When items_add is called, we
  add the item to the client lookups if the item is new to us,
  otherwise we update the existing item the client already has.
  But we haven't been assembling a new list of clientside
  items.
  - This was a problem for Route_List, which was processing
    the raw list of unresolved items from the server, so
    the route list was inadvertently adding duplicate list
    entries to the route list.

More Landmarks fixes and tweaks.

- Fix problem with normal cue sheet height
  only being 50% of the space, and what's
  beneath it being empty. The problem is
  the visible setting of it and the landmarks
  cue sheet when the panel is first drawn --
  both are includeInLayout, so each takes half
  the space, but when one panel is then hidden,
  the other doesn't fill the void.
- Make street name in route directions an
  underlined Hyper_Link and catch the Very
  Useful "link" flex event (TextEvent), which
  lets us embed <a href> in htmlText and get
  events when the user clicks the linked text.
  - Now, instead of the "Locate" hyperlink,
    we can just link from the street name in
    the directions, e.g., if the directions
    are "Turn N on to Hennepin Ave", we can
    hyperlink "Hennepin Ave" (so when they
    click the street name, we pan and zoom
    the map to that part of the route).
- We were showing the landmarks cue sheet for
  all routes, instead of limiting it to just
  those routes in the experiment.
- Add "Edit Landmarks" button.
  - For developers just for now, to help test
    the landmarks editing cue sheet used for
    the experiment. (To wire for real, we'd
    have to add landmarks to the dirty route
    and wire pyserver to save them. For the
    experiment, we just save landmarks to some
    special landmarks tables).

  can perform the operations they could not perform
  when G.initialized was not set (like sending GWIS

Landmarks bugfixes:
- If the user clicked "Finish Experiment"
  but didn't type any text, and then they
  click "Done", nothing is sent to the server.
  The client, however, disables the experiment,
  but the next time the user logs on, they can
  resume the experiment.
  - I made it so that the feedback command is
    sent regardless.
  - Furthermore, the two commands,
    landmark_exp_active_get and landmark_exp_begin,
    check the feedback table to see if the user
    has completed the experiment.
- Disable experiment button after user finishes.
- Check that this.cmd_mgr not null in Route panel's
  can_close; similar to problem described earlier
  about route being nulled from panel but panel
  still being processed on logout.

r31539 | landonb | 2014-04-22 17:33:31 -0500 (Tue, 22 Apr 2014) | 28 lines

Landmarks bugfix:
- When typing at normal to quick speed in the "Other:"
  edit box, it was defocusing and refocusing after
  every keypress, and sometimes the input would be
  deleted.
  - Also, some keypresses were being processed by
    the map, i.e., while the edit box was defocused
    the map thought is was in focus, and so it would
    respond, e.g., by turning the region layer on.
 - The problem is that the DATA_CHANGE event was
   being allowed to be processed by the DataGrid,
   which would clobber the list entry components
   and make us rebuild and reset everything, including
   refocusing the edit box.
   - It was if the user typed during this moment
     between the out of focus and the in-focus that
     most problems were occurring, but it was also
     a pain to refocus and to try to reset the caret
     position correctly.
 - I added hooks on the DATA_CHANGE event for all
   interactive components -- this solves the problem
   of the edit box losing focus.
   - Also, I added code that use TextLineMetrics
     to figure out the header height, so we no
     longer have the flicker problem or the
     clipping problem! The height problems appear
     to be fixed...

Oops, last checkin also included:
- To landmarks experiment floater,
  tailor the hint to the state of the map.
  - Renamed, e.g., "Get Route 1 of 5" to
    "Get Next Route (1 of 5)" and updated
    the tip so it's more clear that the button
    completes the current route.
  - If the user has not checked out a route,
    the tip suggests clicking the Get Next Route
    button to get started.
  - Swapped the order of the the floating panel
    widgets: the instructions and finish experiment
    buttons are now at the bottom, and the name
    of the current route and the Locate button
    at the the top. This seems more untuitive. It
    felt like the route name and locate button were
    hard to find.
  - If the route panel is not active or open, the
    tip says to click Locate to reopen it.

Landmarks bugfixes to list entry renderer:
- In route direction, when you select a checkbox to add
  a landmark, the route step header name is updated. If
  the name is a line longer than previously, it'll push
  the landmarks content below the next data grid item,
  which clips the entry so the last item or two are no
  longer useable.
  - The code is updated to fix the height when appropriate,
    but it's still not perfect and it causes a tiny flicker.
    But a little flicker is better than clipping, right?
- Fix the width setting of the entry's runtime-created
  Text label. If we don't set it, it's as wide as it
  needs to be and the text isn't wrapped -- this is
  because we create and configure the Text before
  it's inserted into the entry container, so it has
  no reference to the container dimensions while
  being setup and it's just as wide as it wants.
  - The old code was setting the width to a constant;
    now we use this.explicitWidth like the other
    width-adjusted components in the class do.
- When the "Other:" option is selected, after each
  character is typed in the tag edit box, the edit
  box was losing focus. This was because a data
  change event was triggered, and then we'd rebuild
  the list of landmarks and make a new text edit
  box.
  - We still rebuild the list of landmarks, but
    we reuse the text edit box, and we call
    setFocus and setSelection to return focus
    and the cursor to where it was previously.
- Listen on header text height change so we
  can adjust list entry height so that the
  landmarks list doesn't clip.
  - This isn't perfectly implemented; it's
    meant to replace the kludge that causes
    the flicker but it's not ironed out yet.
- Set the hand cursor for the list entry
  checkboxes and labels, and disable
  scroll policies.
  - When I was figuring out how to get
    the heights and widths adjusted correctly,
    I sometimes ended up with annoying
    scrollbars that obscured the content,
    so I got rid of the scrollbars.

  flashclient crashed on a null reference trying to store

Landmarks bugfix: Don't allow landmarks GWIS
commands to be canceled by Update_Branch
request (they can only be trumped by an
Update_User).
- This was causing a problem fetching the
  experiment data after logging on if the
  branch was still loading.

Landmarks fixes:
- If anonymous user clicks "How Can I Help?",
  they'll see the disclaimer, but pressing "Agree"
  brings up the login dialog, and after logging on,
  the login dialog goes away but the disclaimer
  remains, and the user has to click "Agree" again.
  - I fixed this so that the button says
    "I agree. Login to Get Started", and now,
    after logging on, the disclaimer is automatically
    closed and then the experiment is fetched.
  - I also fixed the issue where the user has
    already completed the experiment -- the
    client was not detecting this state, so
    it would show the experiment widgets again.
    Now, the user gets a popup thanking them
    for their interest but letting them down
    gently and telling them to wait for the
    next part of the experiment. Also, the
    How Can I Help? button is hidden.
  - Lastly, if the user starts the experiment
    but doesn't complete it, when they log
    back on, they'll now see "Resume Experiment"
    rather than "How Can I Help?".

Landmarks updates.

- Style guide changes.
  - Remove trailing whitespace.
  - Split
      } else {
    into
      }
      else {
  - Change some strings that are defined 'public var'
    to 'protected static const', to make it more obvious
    that the string doesn't change nor is used outside
    of the class in which it's defined.
  - Convert some "double-quotes to 'single-quotes.
  - Adding log:Logging members to missing classes.
    - Also updated Config_Logging to include new
      log classes (see: scripts/dev/Config_Logging-make.py)
  - DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself.
    - I moved duplicate code in two files to a new fcn. in
      just one of the files.
      - One way to tell: If you see the same long object ref
        a lot in the same fcn., e.g.,
          G.app.landmark_experiment_panel.next_rt_btn.enabled = false;
          G.app.landmark_experiment_panel.instructions_text_box.htmlText =
            G.app.landmark_experiment_panel.instructions_no_routes_txt;
        It probably means the code should be moved to a new function
        in that object. E.g.,
          G.app.landmark_experiment_panel.my_new_function().
  - MAGIC_NUMBERS: I removed the hard-coded '5' in both
    pyserver and flashclient and replaced it with a static
    class variable and added couplet SYNC_ME comments to let
    devs know that the number in flashclient better match
    the number in pyserver.
    - (The '5' is the number of routes used in the experiment.)

Very Cool Auto Aerial Tile Layer Switcher.

- Historically, we've defaulted to the higher-resolution
  Metro-area aerial tiles. So if you click the Aerial button
  above the map, that's what you see. But if you're outstate
  or if you scroll outstate, you won't see any aerial tiles.
  - If you're savvy enough, you might go to Map Settings
    and choose the state tiles from the dropdown, but this
    is tedious and not very discoverable.
  - I added a new, Hybrid layer as the default. It
    automatically chooses which tile to fetch -- metro or
    state -- depending on the tile bbox.
    - I manually calculated and encoded the rectangular
      sub-bboxes of the metro aerial tiles since the
      WFS-reported bbox includes empty space (since the
      actual coverage is not a perfect rectangle).
    - Basically, now when you use Aerial, the fetched tile
      is either from the metro layer or the state layer, as
      appropriate.
- Also, moved aerial handler from UI class to Map class,
  since it affects the tiles on the map.
  - The UI part of it is in the map toolbar and on the map
    settings panel, true, but the central control logic
    belongs in the map class.
- Off topic: Added links to external Cycloplan exports
  location (the one with all the Shapefiles) from the
  Cycloplan panel and the Map Legend.
  - Also make map legend editing hints panel resize
    automatically, as window and map sizes change.

Update ccp.py so you can test routes with it.

- Very fast way to test route-finding, especially
  if you use the other trick of only loading a
  portion of the map into the route finder.
  - I went from waiting ten minutes between
    tests and code changes to just a few
    seconds.

Lots of p3 updates and fixes.

- Add new rating+facility weight (it lets you use
  both sliders and returns the average cost).
- Lots of comments about the algorithms I've
  implemented.
  - The rating weight can be adjusted so that
    it's more or less sensitive, i.e., the user
    can adjust the difference in cost between
    successive ratings.
    - I've used a geometric progression, don't worry.
  - The bike-to-facilities algorithm is adjusted
    slightly to weight facilities that are on-road
    a tad heavier than segregated facilities (though
    not so much that they're as heavy as a road without
    any facilities).
- When loading the route finder, remember the last
  revision seen in the Shapefile so we can immediately
  update to the most recent revision in the database.
- Catch more errors when edges are not found in the
  graph.
- Fix misuse of max(x, 4) -- we want min(x, 4)!

Add a Very Long comment to the p1 planner about why
the Bikeability cost function is incorrectly implemented.

- The gist is that the Bikeability slider can only
  find one of two types of routes -- either the
  shortest route, or a route with some constant
  amount of Bikeability. You might get slight
  variations in the route using the slider, but
  the slider doesn't affect the cost scaling when
  calculating the route. It only affects how the
  cost is averaged between the shorted route and
  the bikeable route.
  - To fix this, the bikeability slider should
    affect the "spread" of costs between different
    ratings, e.g., how much more a "Good" road
    costs than an "Excellent" road. In the current
    implementation, the costs are static, regardless
    of the slider.
  - Also, the spread should use a geometric progression,
    rather than an arithmetic progression, otherwise
    the differences between successive ratings is
    not constant and equal. This causes the problem
    that the algorithm will disproportionately favor
    certain ratings over others.

Route planner p3 updates.

- Add rating spread option for the Bikeability
  algorithm (will probably replace p1's priority;
  it's similar in intent but implemented correctly).
  - Also add new column to user_ and user_preference
    tables, and propagate throughout code like other
    user-adjustable route options.
- Add some timing fcns. to route_get to try to figure
  out which sub-routines are bottlenecking route
  checkout.
- Add the existing 'rsn_min', 'rsn_max', 'n_steps',
  'beg_nid', and 'fin_nid' stat attributes to the route
  class -- these values have been calculated for a
  freshly saved route (or for existing routes) by a
  big SQL function, but for routes not being saved
  (e.g., from ccp.py, if you're testing, or for
  route segments being stitched into a changed
  route), we didn't calculate these values.
  - If the new route is not being saved, we'll
    calculate these stats for the client. (That
    is, the client could also calculate these
    stats, but it's easy for the server to do
    it, too. -- Also, the client cannot calculate
    the average cost, because we don't send edge
    weights, and we're calculating the average
    cost now, and the other values happen to come
    for free.)
- Add new route stat: 'avg_cost'.
  - This is the per-unit (per-meter) average cost
    of each line segment in the route. It's not
    the Bikeability rating, though -- it's whatever
    cost the user requested to be used to calculate
    the route (see the different edge weights used
    by the p3 planner).
- Scale all p3 edge costs by 10 since we round to
  the nearest whole number. This makes our resolution
  one decimeter, e.g., before, a 1/2-meter road might
  end up with the same cost as a 1-1/2 meter road.
  This doesn't seem like a lot, but we have lots of
  small segments at intersections, so this error
  might add up.

Major bugfix in geocoder:

It would misinterpret addresses as being very-confident
region matches, and it would devolve the geocoded point
to the center of the region, rather than returning the
matching address location.
- E.g., 
  ./ccp.py \
    --route \
    --from "waldo road and airport road, two harbors" \
    --to "7th st and 8th av, two harbors" \
    --p3 --p3-weight length --p3-spread 4 --p3-burden 20
  says the points are too close to route because both
  addresses resolved to the region name Two Harbors.
- Also, don't raise when you can't reach the external
  geocoder. We could alert the user about the problem,
  but we might also find a good match in the Cyclopath
  database.
  - Also, it's useful for developers if they're offline
    that they can test the route finder using points and
    regions.

Fix to the break_here feature to detect daemon scripts.

- The break_here fcn. would detect if the script was

  remote debugging.

Be more deliberate about WKT vs. EWKT.

The geometry utility class wasn't consistent with
its wkt functions, some of which would read one
format or the other, and some which would return
one format or the other.

  xy_to_wkt_line is now complemented by
  xy_to_ewkt_line.

Landmarks Experiment Pt. 2

Argh, I commited duplicate comments in the log, sorry!
I totally forgot to run `svn up` before running `svn log`!
Anyway, please ignore the duplicate commit comments from
Fernando in the previous checkin...

Landon's fixes and changes (for pyserver; for this checkin):

- I changed name_list from a list() to a set().
  It's only used for checking if the name of an item was
  seen previously, and list is way slower than set
  when it comes to checking membership. E.g.,

setup = '''
aset = set()
alst = list()

for n in xrange(100):
  aset.add(n)
  alst.append(n)
'''

import timeit

min(timeit.Timer('99 in aset', setup=setup).repeat(7, 1000000))
# 0.0319 secs.

min(timeit.Timer('99 in alst', setup=setup).repeat(7, 1000000))
# 0.745 secs.

  You can see how much slower it is to check a list for item membership,
  since the whole list has to be walked.

- I found a place where the instance fcn., step.landmarks_compute,
  was being called rather than the class fcn., landmark.landmarks_compute.
  Fernando, please let me know if I missed something from your branch.

- Don't run landmarks_compute unless conf.landmarks_experiment_active
  (I timed the fcn. and it takes a few seconds on my dev machine).

- Fix ST_Crosses call: It was creating the EWKT from a plain WKT,
  but I've fixed issues elsewhere where EWKTs and WKTs were being
  confused, so I've renamed some geometry.py fcns. and added others.

- If a Geometry item doesn't have a name, that value can be None.
  I added a try/except block in landmarks_big_crossings to avoid
  crashing on the None.
  MAYBE: Fernando, I'm not sure if you want to handle this case
         in a different manner. For now, we're skipping items
         without names and not adding them to step.landmarks.

- As a matter of practive, prefer xrange to range -- the former
  is a generator, and the latter is a big list.

Landmarks Experiment Pt. 2

Landon's fixes and changes (flashclient):
- Move globals from G.as to appropriate places, i.e.,
  on/off switch to Conf_Instance (since we would like it
  off by default in the public code), and all the others to
  the map object (so that we don't have
- Style guide changes (mostly whitespace and too-wides).
- To the landmarks floating panel, next to the Route title,
  add a little "Locate" hyperlink that centers the maps
  around the route and activates the route panel.
- When clicking "Go to Route..." button, the route panel
  was opening but wasn't being activated.

Fernando's checkins... I think somehow this wasn't attached
to a previous commit:

  appropriate.
* Fix problem in Flashclient not discarding items when
  panning/zooming. We were doing an " in " on an Array...
  what a no-no.
* When preempting re-labeling, we weren't rescheduling
  the fcn.
* I added preemption to items_discard, otherwise it can
  starve the GUI (when thousands of items are loaded,
  since the discard routine iterates over them all).
  * I also added preemption to geofeatures_redraw.
* Don't fetch Regions unless region layer is turned on.
* A item is not labelable if it's outside the view rect.

Fix Export Shapefile: missing wconnected, and added
last-edited rid and author, and first-edited rid and author.

Bug fixes to release:
* Go back to default WKT without SRID. I think
  all the code can handle WKT either way, but
  I'm not positive (export script was failing
  because OGR expects WKT without SRID).
* Add enums for geofeature class z-level defaults.
  * Also set default z-level when bulk-saving.
* Implement bulk import and export of non-byways
  (regions, waypoints, and terrain) using the
  same hausdorff script -- minimal changes were
  changes, phew!
* Hausdorff import was forgetting to set gia.name...
  (can easily fix existing db records with
   one SQL statement).
* maint.sh was still referencing old "last"/"next"
  instead of "sib1"/"sib2".

  tree, rather than just rely solely on
  the geofeature layer type.
* Add checks for and isolate features
  without geometry or with ring geometry.
* Fix error trying to delete the same item
  twice -- happens when two features in the
  Shapefile sharing the same stack ID are both
  marked delete.
* New option --checkout-revision, to indicate
  from which revision to checkout items, for

  Shapefile but across revisions (i.e., just

Further implement is_disconnected; some Hausdorff import fixes;
and other miscellany.

Flashclient: Fix problem loading user's default preferences.
* Problems is from CcpV1: if the user logins explicitly (with
their password), we'll fetch their preferences. But if the
user loads Cyclopath and is auto-logged in (with their token)
the defaults are retrieved from flash cookies.
** The problem happens with new preferences: if using a token
and a new version of flashclient adds preferences, since
flashclient was just loading from flash cookies and not
checking for null, bad preference values were being loaded.
*** The solution was easier than this explanation: just set
decent defaults if the flash cookie returns null, sheesh.
** However, this leaves one problem: if a user changes
their settings on one browser, the changes won't be
reflected in our browsers until the user logs off and
back on again.

Some p3 planner bugfixes (typos(wrong class names);
I'm still testing for code coverage, obviously).

More is_disconnected logic:
* Add list of impassable byway tags.
** When geocoding an address or point to the nearst byway,
we were only considering the byway rating and geofeature_layer
id, but for route finders that don't use personalized ratings,
if a byway was tagged impassable or controlled, we might
accidentally still use it as a route_stop.
* Move is_disconnected def'n from byway to geofeature class,
since the column is defined "not null".

Hausdorff fixes:
* Bulk-save byway split-from id should by Psql NULL and
not the string, "null", for new byways. Same for "created_by".
* Incorrect item_user_access item_type_id was being saved.
* Also use new list of controlled-access tags, and mark
controlled access line segments and is_disconnected.
* During preprocessing, quarantine features without
geometry or whose geometry forms a ring (both endpoints
are within a decimeter of one another).
* Fix item checkout: Checkout at one revision before
the latest, since the other scripts running in parallel
are also editing items and may delete items. Each script
should use the one-before revision to ensure all items
fetched are the same and not mangled by another import
process.
* Fix incorrect valid_start_rid being saved to group_item_access.
** Same with deleted; we weren't updating the gia record
after validizing the item but before generating the bulk-save
gia sql.

More new Planner p3 route finder implementation and fixes.

* Add old Multimodal route options to user preferences,
  and add new p3 planner options to same.
** Also, don't require all preferences be set to
   save preferences changes.
** Update database prefs tables with p3 options.

* Add --p1, --p2, --p3 to ccp.py so user can choose
  which finder to use.

* Fix recent change to add other calculated ratings
  to Cyclopath export Shapefile (SQL error).

* When geofeature fetches geometry in WKT format,
  it should use ST_AsEWKT and not just ST_AsText
  so that the SRID is included (otherwise the
  geometry cannot be re-inserted into the database
  with prepending the SRID information, so just make
  PostGIS do it on checkout).

* The p3 finder now loads a set of weights for each
  edge, so the client can choose from a handful of
  different weight types (i.e., route by shortest
  distance, or by highest rated roads, or prefer
  trails and bike facilities).

* Add CLI switches to route daemon to specify where
  to find Shapefile or Zipfile for the p3 planner.

* More Hausdorff import script fixes.
** Fix to problem adding duplicate aadt and rating
   rows.
** Don't mark some grac record attributes until
   after item validation.
** Add CCP_SYS field.
** Fix to creating new tags (not new tag-link_values,
   but new tags themselves).
** Fix to merging byway names by inner route names.

Oops, last checkin was supposed to be just the one file...
here's the changelog for the last revision:

Beginnings of new, static p3 route finder.
- Uses fixed weights and NetworkX to speed up
  graph search.
- Change a few routed interface defaults to
  not assume a rating or weight fcn. available.
- Can now create route_step from Shapefile feature.

Also, update to Hausdorff Import script.
- Lots of bugfixes, and a few tweaks to
  the matching algorithm. I've got
  process_edits (the last fcn. of the three)
  working for most data, but as the scripts
  run, I keep bumping into errors (mostly
  with duplicate or incorrect stack ID
  integrity errors when trying to commit).
  So it's not quite done yet...

Bulk item insert fcns; better point equality checking; etc.

* Add geofeature-name-to-ID-lookup, for importing
  Shapefiles.
* Replace uses of Decimal() with round(), and add
  threshold when comparing points for equality.
* Move node cache maker's Ctrl-C handler to
  script args base class so other scripts can
  use the multi-processor architecture.
* Make bulk-insert item fcns., so you can save
  multiple records to database quickly (skips
  permissions checking and item validation (assumes
  you've checked it first)). One for each item
  class and also aux. data like ratings and aadt.
* Add item_mgr tag name cache.
* Looking up geofeature layer name in database
  now lower()s and replaces spaces with underscores,
  so values in Shapefile are friendlier.
* When looking for node matches, use ST_DWithin
  rather than geometry equivalence, since we
  assume nodes within 1 decimeter of one another
  are spatially the same.
  * Also, use ST_DWithin and not ST_Buffer,
    because indexing makes the former a heck
    of a lot faster.
  * Also fixed some places that were specifying
    tolerance where precision was expected.
    * Also, node endpoint reference count should
      only be incremented for fresh byways, since
      it's otherwise fetched from the database (so
      we don't need to build it on fetch, but we
      need to increment it when adding byways).
      When byways were being updated and saved,
      this value was generating a complaint (though
      I'm not sure if it was being saved incorrectly).
* Change osgeo import ordering to fix problem with
  Fiona griping when we import the latter.
* Reveal 'valid_start_rid', 'acl_grouping', and
  'link_lhs_type_id' and 'link_rhs_type_id' in
  group_item_access class, for help with bulk-insert
  (until now, these values were just managed by
  way of the item to which they're attached, but
  now you can create unattached group_item_access
  for easier bulk item editing).
* Fcn. to fetch all link_value attrs for user-agnostic
  types (marked multiple_allowed, like item watchers).

* New point comparison that allows for a little inequality,

New Geofeature Layer types:
* Other Ramp, to complement Expressway Ramp.
  In Ccp, Expressway Ramp is implied closed to cyclists,
  but MnDOT tags some free-turn line segments as
  Expressway Ramp. The new Import script changes this
  to Other Ramp if the segment doesn't connect to
  an Expreeway or another Ramp.
* Parking Lot, to complement Sidewalk and Other.
  Going through the State data, I found that users
  had added a number of line segments through parking
  lots in the outer 'burbs. Or maybe there was a road
  there years ago and recently, e.g., a shopping mall
  was built.
* Private Road- another way to imply that a road is
  not bikeable but not an Expressway, and without
  having to use the closed tag.

Simple Shapefile import script.

- Uses Fiona instead of OGR. Fiona is such a pleasure to use!
  See: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona
  and  http://toblerity.org/fiona/index.html
- For each line segment in one group, finds all the segments
  in another group that are nearby, and computes segmented
  Haursdorff distance to determine if any pair of lines are
  logically the same line.
  - Runs surprisingly fast (over 1,000 pairs processed per
    second on my 4-core virtual machine).
    - We're using our new Python-implemented Hausdorff routine
      and not relying on PostGIS ST_HausdorffDistance.
- Detects changes in the Shapefile and applies the changes
  to the Cyclopath database.
  - Uses bulk SQL insert (i.e., calls INSERT once with all
    changes rather than calling INSERT many times with changes
    just for one item). This means we're skipping the pyserver
    item classes and going straight to the database (and also
    skipping checking permissions, etc.).
  - For split lines and duplicate lines, we copy relevant
    geofeature fields, duplicate link_values, and also
    copy byway ratings, item watchers, and other meta
    data about items.
- The script can be told to process a subset of features in
  the Shapefile so that you can call this script in parallel
  to feed a bunch of cores.

New Revision.revision_lock_dance to enhance maintenance mode.

- When a user or a script initiates a commit and locks the
  revision table, record the start time of the commit.
  - If another user tries to save map changes, they can be
    notified that another commit is in progress (and how
    long it might be until they can save).
  - Ideally, we'd save a user's map edits regardless
    and process them sequentially, kind of like how
    git 'replay' works.
- Add --has-revision-lock switch to scripts, to tell
  the new fcn. that we're the script being run during
  maintenance mode. Otherwise the code will bark at
  you that it's in maintenance mode and you shouldn't
  be running.
  - E.g., if the maintenance mode starts and a user
    sends a commit, the commit will run if it can
    get the revision lock -- and your script will
    just have to wait until it can get the lock.

  * Why the metadata doesn't indicate this is silly!
* I added conf.elevation_units so you can specify the
  DEM encoding.
  * I also give elevation_tiff a None default so that
    new developers can get up and running without a DEM.
* Remember: 0.3048 meters in a foot.

Flashclient support for maintenance mode command.

- When user changes to Edit mode, send kval_get to
  server to check on maintenance mode.
  - If maintenance scheduled, alert user, and let
    them edit and save.
  - If maintenance happening, alert user, and let
    them edit but not save.
  - If neither, alert nothing.
- The maintenance mode alert sits above the map.
  But it's a tricky control: the Text widget doesn't
  accurately report its height until after the widget
  is drawn into the layout -- which means, if you
  specify a 100% height, the widget overtakes the
  map, and so you have to choose a specific height,
  but if you choose too small, the vertical scroll
  bar is shown, and if you choose too large, you
  waste a lot of space.
  - I tried the validateNow() trick and TextLineMetrics,
    but to no avail.
  - As an awesome, tricky work-around, I hide a second,
    unseen text panel beneath the map, so when we change
    the maintenance mode message, we first update the
    hidden widget, and then we use its text height to
    calculate the height for the real message, which we
    can then animate into view.
  - Add fade-in capability to Fadeawayable_VBox.as (it
    used to just gracefully hide a widget; now it gracefully
    shows a widget (and determines the correct height, too,
    so the animation is smooth and accurate)).
  - The user can hide the maintenance mode message, but
    we'll continue pinging the server so we can tell the
    user when maintenance is finished and they can save
    again.

Oops, this msg goes with the last revision (SVN needs better staging):

Rework and implement the hasn't-been-implemented
live maintenance mode feature.

- Store the start time of the maintenance and an optional
  estimate of the final time.
  - The client will tell the user at what clock time the
    maintenance will begin and when we expect it to be complete.
- Also add a revision-table-lock-timestamp so that during
  a long commit, other users trying to commit can be
  informed that a big operation is happening.
  - We also use a pseudo table lock in key_value_pair so
    we can commit the table lock timestamp, which releases
    our table lock.
- The schema-upgrade script will complain if you're
  upgrading the database but aren't in maintenance mode.
- Added new kval_get gwis command to get values from
  key_value_pair, including the new maintenance state values.
  - Also updated ccp.py to send new command (for testing).

Removing leading whitespace from some psql responses.

- Add --no-align to psql calls using -qtc, so now: -qtAc
  With just --tuples-only, the table header and footer

  right-justified a bit.

Fix problems saving and deleting items.
- Flashclient was not interpreting the
  new version from the server correctly.
- Flashclient was expecting version info
  on deleted items, but it's not sent.
  - And Flashclient shouldn't expect GIA
    records, either.
- Fix overzealous assert when deleting
  item while it's being lazy-loaded.
Fix search problems when server response
 is not formatted as expected (i.e., lots
 more null checks in flashclient).

Cool new feature: client search-by-stack-id.
- In Flashclient, enter an item's stack ID to
  be spirited to it.
- Makes it easy for developers who are digging
  around the database to easily find items on
  the map.
  - E.g., I saw a logcheck email about a command
    that failed, and the email contained the stack
    ID, so I was able to load Cyclopath and quickly
    find the item on the map.

==================================================
Fix problem with constraint on geofeature table: We cannot
use subqueries. But for whatever reason, even though our
constraint has a subquery (it calls cp_srid) for whatever
reason I only discovered the problem when trying to run
ogr2ogr (though you can also produce the problem by
SELECT * FROM geometry_columns).
- This schema script drops the old constraint and
  makes a new one with the SRID hard-coded.

DEVS: cd /ccp/dev/cp/scripts ; ./schema-upgrade.py
==================================================
Flashclient Route viewing and editing fixes:
- What was implemented was confusing, nonintuitive,
  and tedious:
  1. Editing a route caused map editing to start, and
     then the user had to use the map save button (on
     the floating tool palette) to save changes to the
     route.
     - It's confusing to the user, maybe, that the
       floating tool palette suddenly appears.
     - That map editing and route editing are committed
       together feels wrong. The map is the geowiki;
       routes are something else, and pinned to a
       specific revision (until re-computed), and don't
       require a changenote. So saving map edits and
       saving route edits should not be triggered by
       the same user action.
  2. The button to indicate that routes are clickable
     is buried on the options page, and it defaults to
     false. But route stops were still hot:
     - When you clicked on the route, no matter what,
       you'd create a new route stop.
     - This would cause a delay in the client.
     - Pyserver would compute two new route segments and
       would burn a new revision.
       - Routes are now revisionless, so you can save a
         new version of a route without burning a map
         revision.
         - In CcpV1, the recent changes list is mostly
           just "auto-computed route segment" revisions,
           which have nothing to do with editing the map.
         - For route history, rather than intertwine with
           the recent map changes list, each route panel
           should just have a list of its changes.
           - (In general, any item panel should list that
              item's edit history.)
- I unwired route editing from the floating tool palette.
  Each route panel now has its own reset/undo/redo/save
  buttons.
  - Among the changes necessary to make this work, I added
    dirty_reason and cmd_mgr_fcn to Text_Field_Editable so
    it can call the correct Command_Manager (and not always
    just G.map.cm, but now it can call a route panel's cmd_mgr).
  - The route panel footer is changed as the user edits a route.
    E.g., for new routes, we suggest to anonymous users that they
    log on to save the route to their library, but if they instead
    edit the route, then the route reset/undo/redo/save buttons
    show up, and the user can edit the route and save it (and
    the user can use the web_link to find the route during a future
    session). We also use nice visual transitions, so the footer
    doesn't just appear in a flash or go away in a jiffy, but it'll
    nicely slide and dissolve into view.
- I moved the routes-clickable option to the bottom of the route
  panel, on the footer (so it's always visible). In CcpV1, it's
  buried on the map display options panel (so most users don't know
  about it, and for those that do, they have to change panels to
  enable or disable the option).
  - I also added a button to indicate if clicking a
    route adds a route stop or just selects the route.
    - In CcpV1, it's annoying because whenever you click the route,
      by default a new route stop is created and two new route
      segments are computed.
  - And now, you can long-press on a route (hold the mouse down
    for a half of a second) and you'll get a route stop and be
    able to drag the route.
  - When you click and drag a route, we no longer auto-
    checkout the new route segments if the user pauses
    long enough with the mouse down. It takes too long
    to get route segments, so the interaction is very
    disruptive (usually, the user has moved the mouse
    again, and then we recompute new-new route segments, and
    then the user experiences an unnecessary "Huh?!" moment).
  - Clicking a route stop did not start dragging it, even though
    we were changing the mouse cursor to the pointy finger hand.
  - After dragging and releasing the mouse, we were clearing
    the straight, dashed lines to the new destination, but
    we weren't clearing the arrows. Now, we leave both the
    dashed line and arrows until the new route segments are
    loaded, and then we clear both of them.
  - New routes by anonymous users were not editable. E.g., anon
    users could not drag their new routes around.
- Fixed route labels.
  - We were showing labels for routes in the route list that
    weren't on the map.
  - We were drawing the label without determining the label
    position so it went to the upper left of the map. Now we
    wait for the route to become hydrated so we can determine
    the label from the route geometry.
  - I moved the Byway label-maker fcn. to Geofeature so
    that Route can also use that fcn., which computes the
    label position in the middle of a line segment and
    determines a rotation for it (albeit the label
    doesn't follow the line geometry, unfortunately).
  - Route labels were not being displayed when they
    collided with byway labels, so I enhanced the
    collision detector to give preference to route labels.
    - Also, route labels now have a colorful background to
      distinguish them from byway labels.
    - Also, now we have to relabel the map whenever a
      route is selected or deselected. The downside is
      there's a little flicker, but more importantly,
      it takes a second to relabel the map (the collision
      detector is O(n^2), I think).
  - The A, B, C, etc. route stop labels were not being drawn,
    or they were being hidden inadvertently.
    - I added a new map canvas layer so that route stop labels
      live on top of other labels, and atop route stops and routes.
  - On get-route failure, or if the user cancels the request, we
    remove the beg_addr and fin_addr (geocoded address) labels from
    the map, rather than leaving them there.
  - The route labels were not being updated after dragging a route.
- Fix double-click on route not to do three things: 1. select
  route, 2. recenter, and 3. zoom in, but just to select the route
  and recenter (zooming in takes a while and is very annoying;
  so now the user is required to be deliberate about zooming the map
  when it appears they're just interacting with a route).
- Fix the route "filter" checkbox in the Route_List_Entry: since
  a route can be in more than one Route_List, when the user unchecks
  the route in one of the lists, we need to uncheck it in the other
  lists, and then we maybe remove the route from the map, so long as
  it's not attached to an active panel, like its route panel, or to
  a discussion panel or a reaction panel. Until now, routes would
  remain on the map even after you closed their panel and unchecked
  their Route_List_Entry checkboxes.
- Fix issues with route Web links (deep links).
  - Permissions were not being calculated correctly in the client,
    so user could not edit the route after getting a Web link.
  - The server nows sends the Session ID group stack ID to the
    client, so that flashclient can accurately update
    access_infer_id based on the group_item_access records.
  - After committing or making a web_link, the server sends back
    each item's group_access records, access_infer_id, and new
    version, so that flashclient can check its math against the
    server's (and ultimately use what the server says, but this
    behavior is beneficial, because it tests the client's access
    control functions).
  - Pyserver was trying to UPDATE a nonexistent group_item_access
    record instead of INSERTing a new one.
  - Flashclient was not telling Pyserver to use the session_id
    when committing changes to an anonymous user's route that
    wasn't fetched with a Web link.
  - Flashclient was incorrectly using http://blah.com/private?
    for anonymous routes, rather than http://blah.com/get?,
    for the Web link URL. (The private? URL causes flashclient
    to require you to log on to load the Web link, which doesn't
    make sense for anonymous routes).
- Fix problem not computing and sending route length to client
  (the client could just as well add up all the route step lengths,
  but pyserver needs to store the value in the database, so doing
  it there).
- Fix Routes Looked At problems.
  - It was showing the library list for anonymous users on boot,
    rather than showing an empty list.
  - For anonymous users, flashclient handles the looked at list,
    rather than trying to checkout a page of a user's viewing
    history from the server.
  - For logged in users, flashclient updates the looked at list
    if the user is on the first page of history results, otherwise
    it doesn't have to do anything (but when the user returns to the
    first page of results, flashclient will ask pyserver for it,
    so the looked at list will be current).
  - Flashclient was wrongly trying to set an item_findability
    view record for anonymous users (pyserver disallows this so
    it would just return an error, but then the alert dialog
    confuses/aggravates the user).
  - I fixed the "Clear All" and "Select All" buttons.
    - Select All is not a good feature. It already takes a number
      of seconds to check out a route, so a button that checks out
      _twenty_ routes at once is ridiculous (the user would wait
      minutes for them to load). So I removed the Select All button.
    - For "Clear All", I changed it into three buttons,
       "Uncheck All" on the left,
      and then one or two of three buttons on the right,
       depending on what routes are selected in the route list:
       "Remove Checked" and "Removed Unchecked", or "Remove All".
      So now the buttons are:
        Uncheck all routes in the list;
        Remove all routes in the list and all user's history (all pages);
        Remove routes that are checked in the list (max. one page); and
        Removed routes that are not checked in the list (max. one page).
      - Remove All applies to all routes in the history, and
        not just to the page of results the user is viewing.
        The Remove All button is only visible when nothing is
        checked in the list.
- Fix problem when closing an active route panel and being returned
  to the second routes tab, the Explore Routes tab, rather than to
  the last panel viewed or to the Get Directions routes tab.
- Fix display flicker in route reaction: before changing
  to the 'input' or 'thank' state, make sure the two
  containers are created and visible and includeInLayout
  (otherwise you'll see them for a split second and then
  they'll disappear).
- Reworded some of the text on the routes panels and fixed the
  "It's lonely in here" label that has the "Get Directions"
  button, used when the routes viewed list is empty. So we hide
  the Route_List and the Uncheck All and Remove * buttons when
  nothing is in the list, and we show the silly message instead.
- Fix the Route Description widget (it's not visible in CcpV1,
  but you can set the value from mobile... so now it's visible
  in flashclient, always).
- Add checkbox for route cue sheet to show/hide landmarks text.
  - Thanks, Fernando!
Other, non-Route related Flashclient changes:
  - Changed single 'Viewing'-'Editing' toggle button to two buttons,
    'View' and 'Edit'. A power user mentioned having trouble
    re-discovering how to edit (spending minutes looking for the
    button). So make it obvious! =)
  - Also fixed the widths of the tab bar buttons to be the same
    width for each two pairs of buttons, 'Road' and 'Aerial', and
    'View' and 'Edit'. This looks more natural.
  - Fixed a problem with toolTips showing on the button bars,
    which is annoying because the toolTip that's displayed is
    just the name of the hidden button. Smells like a Flex anomaly.
- There was a problem creating a new Waypoint -- you'd just see
  the vertex square on the map, but not the waypoint circle.
  - This may have been a regression just in my working code,
    because after seeing the problem, I was later unable to
    reproduce it.
Pyserver:
- Bug in route_step: we need to specify the branch_id when fetching
  byway steps, otherwise you might get rows for more than one branch.
- Bug when fetching GIA records: use distinct on and order by version
  and acl_grouping to get the latest record for the desired revision
  (otherwise, multiple records might be fetched for the same item stack ID).
- Stealth Secret:
   - New items' new group_item_access records were not being created
     (the code was UPDATEing version+1 of the item... which is a no-op,
     since adding the stealth secret doesn't create a new item version).
   - Also fixed save() flow with new dirty reasons to distinguish
     between item changes and grac changes, so we don't bump the
     item version (and write new item records) when we're just
     adding or changing group_item_access records.
- Cleanup of abnormal "import" convention that was applied in
  half the source files that included it, but not the other half:
  Instead of: import lxml.etree as et
         now: from lxml import etree
  - I got tired of typos because half the files used one format,
    and the other half the other. Just use the Python standard.
Skins:
- Fix zoom level label sizes (needs to be at least 9 pixels).

Run tilecache_seed in 1/3rd the time: group z_levels into just 3 groups, rather than having 9 layers for the 9 z_levels. This means some bridges won't draw perfect on tiles (the underpass and overpass will be drawn on the same layer), but it's better than waiting forever for tiles to be created. And there are very few bridge levels used other than the middle one, "134" (so bridge levels 130-133 get drawn on one layer, then level 134, and then levels 135-8).

- Lots and lots of fixes to MapServer tile generation, especially the
  new zoom levels, 5 though 8, and getting them to look nice and show
  bike facilities and bike labels. ([lb] notes that MapServer is a bear
  to work with... it takes a long time to test changes, and it's hard
  to get it to do what you want/expect, and sometimes you must compromise.)
  - Also add lots more columns to tiles_mapserver_zoom to feed values to
    the MapServer config that cannot be set from the SQL checkout values...
    which basically begs the question, why are some MapServer config options
    settable via the SQL checkout but others can only be hardcoded? Because
    of the latter, we might as well just hardcode all the values for the
    thousands of LAYERs and CLASSes we define... what a pain! =)
- Add geofeature layer IDs for railroad and water flowlines... which we don't
  have time to implement this month, anyway, but the IDs are there, at least...
- Updates to byway rating script (which re-calculates generic ratings).
  - Add debug option to run on specific stack ID, to help debug.
  - Bugfix: Add newish BSIR and CBF7 rater usernames to SQL.
- Node cache maker script: add code to better estimate script runtime.
- Flashclient: Use alpha on bike facil icons when aerial enabled.
- Flashclient: Bugfix: Geofeature assert because Region not overriding
  label_parms_compute.
- Fix problem determining winningest_bike_facil for cluster cache (was
  not being set for clusters that actually do have bike_facility set).
- Fix byway rating to return 0 when 'prohibited' or 'closed' tag applied.

- MnDOT import: make link_value update an option
  you have to specify.
  - We shouldn't update existing link_values, since I'm not
    very confident the data is accurate.
  - Which is to say, the MnDOT data is accurate: it's from this
    year, and the Cyclopath data (like number of lanes) is from
    2007, unless users have kept it current.
  - But using Hausdorff isn't perfect. For example, consider
    six parallelish roads: two couplets of a freeway, two
    entrance ramps, and two frontage roads on either side.
    Because of where existing Cyclopath lines fall, and
    because there are many parallel roads, and because
    our code doesn't compare geofeature_layer_id to MnDOT's
    route system ID, we'll probably not do a good job matching
    line segments and would probably hose our existing data
    (e.g., write the freeway's number of lanes to the frontage
    road).
- Misc. bug fixes to MnDOT import (I tested updating geom. and
  lvals. in the same run and found a few issues).
  - Missing interpolator in string statement.
  - Was changing valid_until_rid of old lvals but not adding
    the new link_value (for-loop was wrongly <continue>ing).
- Pyserver: Commit and import call staticmethod to hup routed
  and Mr. Do!, and now that Mr. Do! stores its port number in
  key_value_pair, callers have to pass a db now so the port can
  be looked up (I cxpx'd code and left self.qb.db by accident,
  but at least the MetC import committed before the NameError
  happened, ha!).
- Fix problem calling ccp_bash if you previosly `set -e` since
  `readlink` bails (asserts last error, or $?) on non-symlinks.

Pyserver:
- Add option to not peek at sequence values, so that
  some operations can run in parallel without each

- Change 'slow fcn.' warnings in item_mgr to only
  print once per script, otherwise you'll get a ton
  of redundant warnings...
- Wrap the caller's callback in item_mgr's bulk-load fcn,
  so if the callback fails, we can print the caller's
  error and a description of the geofeature being
  processed (like, its name and stack ID),
  otherwise the upstream error handler
  just reports the error in item_mgr
  (that the callback failed) which
  is none help at all.
- Remember CBF7 and BSIR ratings in byway_rating.
- Fix some errors in recently changed rating code.
- Fix inaccurate complaints from node_byway about
  intersections' byway counts.
- When finding a node endpoint, instead of getting
  just one random match at an x,y coordinate, we need
  to get all matches and compare against what the caller
  might be expecting: we don't trust the user to specify
  node endpoint IDs via GWIS, but we can at least use what
  they say it is to make an intelligent decision when an
  endpoint is part of two or more intersections.

Bugfixes to work item: import (which hasn't been tested in a while,
  and there have been many changes to pyserver since last tested):
  - Typos in new code that hups routed.
  - The code that accommodates truncated names (e.g., MetC Shapefile
    has a 44-char name field, so some Cyclopath names got blasted)
    is now fixed and applies just to MetC shp specifically (though
    we should probably add code to detect name field length for any
    Shapefile and always check for truncated names, since this problem
    probably isn't MetC-specific).
  - Coalesce some immediate warnings into stats that'll be printed at
    end of import, so it's easier to process all of the warnings (since
    they're grouped by type, and not just interleaved with one another).

- Pyserver: Add Bicycle Safety Rating calculation to
  generic rating calculator, and guess speed limit
  for existing Chicago Bike Federation Algorithm No. 9,
  since for Statewide we don't have speed limit data
  and the naive heuristic is pretty pathetic.
- Reduce zoom even further, now 5 to 19 (was 9 to 19,
  then 6 to 19, but need 5 to fit whole State in my
  laptop viewport).
- In Flashclient, use separate and longer GWIS timeout
  for route requests: GWIS timeout was 90 seconds, but
  requesting a route across the State, e.g., from
  Saint Vincent to Brownsville, takes a few minutes.
- MnDOT import script now imports attributes (and makes
  tag- and attribute-link_values).
- Some other fixes to the MnDOT import script, and more
  checks against data to issue complaints about suspect
  calculated values.

==========

Flashclient: Fix problem using remote Cyclopath tiles, i.e.,
when debugging on a dev machine but using tiles from a remote
server. The problem was that the remote URL was being prefixed
to the aerial URL, so aerial tiles weren't loading.

Change lowest Ccp zoom from 9 to 6: Greater MN, holmeses!
- Changed Conf.as, conf.py, and resolutions= in tilecache.cfg.

In tilecache.cfg, increase bbox= to match meta tile size,
otherwise new zoom level 7 won't render.

Fix problem in wms_instance.map: its MINSCALEDENOM and
MAXSCALEDENOM need to be looser to accommodate errors
in calculating the value (zoom 7 wouldn't render with
the old calculation; now we +/- 25% the calculated
scale denominator value to the min and max).

tilecache_update should check tile_x/ymin/max is not None,
rather than not True/False, otherwise tiles that start at
0,0 will not be rendered.

MnDOT import script adds county names to revision changenote.

Big change to pyserver: Rather than locking tables using
'EXCLUSIVE' mode, use 'SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE' mode. This is
almost just as strict, but INSERTs with FOREIGN KEY
references won't be blocked, and since this is a Wiki, we
never DELETE rows, so we should never need to be 'EXCLUSIVE'.

Squelch a bevy of verbosey pyserver trace statements.

Add missing RESET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT/SET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT TO 0
to db_glue after row lock failure on nonexistant row.

  (the code 'del's the attr, so use try/except AttributeError).
- In Diff mode, the TabButtonBar width was being assigned a

  are just revision numbers) to be truncated, e.g., "12345"
  became "12...".
- Implement Diff mode for bike facility widget: show and paint

Merge Bug 2788 branch from Mikhil:
- On commit, if just adding a new link_value, need to
  load item_mgr's attc cache (otherwise the link's lhs,
  or attr, is not found).
- Pyserver bugfix: self.revision, not self.rev.
- Fix revision.Diff (hooray!).
- Lots and lots of little fixes to Diff Mode.
Some more changes by Landon:
- Rather than converting query_filter stack ID lookup stack IDs
  to and from the hack ID when using the lookup, override the
  Array class with a new array type, Stack_Id_Array, that unhacks
  the ID before storing it in the array.
- Reimplemented the new Item_Revisioned.consensus fcn: when in
  diff mode, you can only select one item at a time in flashclient,
  so there's no need to iterate through items_selected and act like
  we don't know what's in it. If we're in diff mode, there are just
  the two counterpart items.
  - I also changed a bunch of other Objutil.consensus calls
    Item_Revisioned.consensus calls, for places where the diff
    text was not being computed.

Flashclient
- Three Big Ones:
  1. Selection Resolver fixed
  2. Find Route button now always visible
     (users no longer have to scroll to find it)
  3. Implemented persistable map settings
  - Fixed Selection Resolver: we were using G.map_canvas to
    find all items under the cursor, but it only returns one
    item; we have to query the stage instead.
    - Also fixed a bug from CcpV1, where selection resolver
      only orders by z_level, but within each z_level, it
      doesn't order by sprite order. So, if you clicked an
      intersection and the selection resolver automatically
      chose a byway, it wouldn't necessarily choose the byway
      whose sprite is on top.
    - Added new feature: historic behavior is not to use
      selection resolver ever if items are only byways, so,
      e.g., you can never select a byway from a bunch of
      overlapping byways, but flashclient just grabs one
      randomly from the top-most z_level (but not necessarily
      the top-most sprite).
      - I added a settings checkbox to say to always pop
        up the selection resolver whenever two or more items
        are under the mouse cursor.
      - I added a feature where you "long press", or hold
        down the mouse for about one second, on an intersection
        or overlapping items and we pop up the selection resolver.
        - (As an aside, I added a feature where long-pressing
           on "nothing" clears the active selection, to complement
           the existing clicking-on-nothing-clears-selection
           settings checkbox.)
  - Fixed "Find Route" button so it's never hidden, which forces
    user to scroll to find it. The problem is that new users won't
    equate the scroll bar with finding the button to find their route.
    It also looks sloppy -- this is a very important button!
    - The solution is another one of those tricky height-measuring
      dances, but I used a new trick: create the component with
      all scroll bars off, then measure the real height of the
      scroll target, and then set its scroll policy to 'auto'.
      This way, whenever the user resizes the window, you'll
      know the real height of the component, which you can compare
      against the actual height of the parent, and then you can choose
      if the find route button is inline, or if it's a sticky footer.
      If inline, the button is below all if the find route options,
      and it is guaranteed to be visible; if the button is a sticky
      footer, the find route options have a scroll bar, but
      the find route button is always visible on a footer at the
      bottom of the panel.
  - Change search results component that says "Results for blah blah"
    from Label to Text and switched to using htmlText so that the
    component wraps, rather than causing the side panel to put on
    horizontal gain (it grows wider and gets clipped by the right
    side of the side panel).
  - New class and fcns. to remember all of the options on the
    map settings panel (I'm surpirsed these haven't been persistable
    before). Users can also reset to default values.
Pyserver
- Geocoder: When doing a radius search for node_endpoint,
  don't go past 10K, otherwise query takes too long.

================================================================

- Lots of fixes to the events emailer.
  - Moved the email fcns. in misc.py to a new class, emailer.py.
  - Combined all the calls that make emails into a set of classes,
    item.util.watcher_*.py, to make it easy to manage all
    the different types of emails we send (currently: 6
    alert event types, and 1 spam script, makes 7 different
    types of callers that all gait through one final sendmail
    wrapper (and also an experiment script, for landmarks, makes 8)).
    - Reimplemented all of the CcpV1 email messages, which have been
      broken in CcpV2 for a long, long time...
  - See also the cron job which kicks off the event emailer:
    scripts/daily/watchers_emailer.py
    - The production server will call this every minute.
  - In CcpV1, not all sendmail calls cause pyserver to check
    CONFIG's mail_ok_addrs.
    - Developers might accidentally email real users.
    - The code now always checks the email exactly before sendmail.
    - I also changed the meaning of the 'mail_ok_addrs' value: if it
      is empty, it used to mean that all users are okay to email.
      - This seems dangerous: what if a DEV deletes it by accident,
        or what if a new DEV doesn't configure their new Cyclopath
        site correctly in the first place.
      - Now, "mail_ok_addrs: ALL_OKAY" is how you specify
        that all emails are okay to mail.
  - Fix emailer script: instead of UPDATEing key_value_pair,
    DELETE and INSERT.
- Fix db_load.sh to grant permissions on the new PostGIS 2.x topology
  schema and tables, otherwise some PostGIS calls used by pyserver fail.
- Remove newlines from a pyserver log statement -- it was causing logcheck
  to report on each line.
- Remove traces of /item/reminder_email attribute, which doesn't make
  sense to implement. Item reminders are a one-off, special type of
  alert, so they have a custom command. They still use the item_event_alert
  table, but there's no reason to gait them through commit.
  - See GWIS_Item_Reminder_Set.as and command_/item_reminder_set.py,
    which are updated versions of CcpV1's route reaction command.
- Fix to problem saving new link_value when not also saving a new revision:
  don't go the acl_grouping route if the item is new, otherwise
  group_item_access rows don't get written on save.
- Update db_glue to track open cursors, to make it easier to troubleshoot
  trying to commit when another cursor is still open.
  - Also fix a problem with close() not calling curs_close (it was calling
    curs.close).

DEVS: pyserver/CONFIG.template is updated, but you don't
      have to update it unless you want more search results
      (like those from neighboring states).

Flashclient:
- A GWIS_Commit was missing callback_payload.
- a debug trace fix: convert value to int() before .toString(16).
Scripts:
- auto_install: installing new libxml2 requires sudo? weird.
- schema-upgrade: Ignore new 'topology' schema that PostGIS 2.x adds.
Pyserver:
- commit.py: remove obsolete comments
- when geocoding route endpoints, also search region names
  - also update to new search module interface introduced in the
    last checkin (routed geocode was still using old interface).
- fix waypoint's search_center_sql, which was working when
  given a table name but not a geometry.
- add 'confidence' and 'match_code' values to the address
  object, since the external geocoder returns these, and
  it'll help us decide if a geocoded route endpoint is
  good enough that we don't have to search the internal
  Cyclopath database.
  - also grab the state value so we can show results in
    neighboring states (currently, we exclude whatever's
    outside the branch bbox, but we shouldn't act like
    we can't find anything in bordering states; we just
    need to tell the user when results are off the map).
  - also calculate center for external geocode results,
    so search can use it for ordering
    - specifically, an external geocode result is not
      always the first search result that flashclient
      displays. Rather, it's the first if we're confident
      about the result, otherwise it's placed somewhere
      else in the list of results, based on our confidence
      and its distance from the center).
  - fix problem trying to add node endpoints for waypoints
    (just catch AttributeError and do nothing).
- update config parser getlist to accept default value.

=============
PREFACE: [lb] apologizes for the massive checkin; if you've just
run `svn log [some_file]` (and not `svn log` on the whole project),
you might find this message and realize that tracing individual
file changes in CcpV2 is not going to be very fruitful. You're much
better off checking out different revisions and then diffing
those different files, rather than trying to find the answer
in this here very verbose changelog.

(Okay, maybe I don't apologize; sometimes madness means you do
seventy differntly things simultaneously until everything comes
together in one brilliant oneness).

=============
DEVS: Run these commands to upgrade your database (or skip this
      commands and just load a new production dump):

# Start with an alias to your working directory so you can copy
# and paste the following commands.

cp=/dev/ccp/cp

# Create a table of city, state, zipcodes, so users can, e.g., just
# search "55401" and we'll find the "minneapolis" region. The file
# that this script creates is needed by schema-upgrade.py.

cd $cp/scripts/dev
./pyzipcode_setup.py

# Run the new schema upgrade scripts, which add convenience views
# for all item tables, populate the new zipcodes table, and fix
# some problems with the item_event_alert table.

cd $cp/scripts
./schema-upgrade.py

# Add lists of city names, state names, and associated abbreviations
# (like "mpls" for "minneapolis", and "stp" for "saint paul"), and
# print out statistics of commonly-used words that are used as stop
# words by the new CcpV2 search feat.

cd $cp/scripts/setupcp/runic/greatermn
./statewide_munis_lookup.py

# Repopulate the policy table, to add the new link-post-revision policy.

cd $cp/scripts/setupcp/runic
./new_item_policy_init.py

# Build a lookup of city names.

$cp/scripts/setupcp/runic/greatermn/statewide_munis_lookup.py

# Remake all database indices, including some new ones for item alerts.

cd $cp/scripts/setupcp/runic
./ccpv2-add_constraints.sql

# OR: In lieu of all of the above commands, wait a few days until
#     the production server is updated and then you can just db_load
#     a new dump.

=============
DEVS: Upgrade to PostGIS 2.0... with caveats.

You shouldn't need to upgrade PostGIS, but you can, if you want...

You can install most of the software yourself. Copy and paste
commands from the updated gis_compile script, starting with GEOS
and finishing with the make of PostGIS.

 scripts/setup/runic/auto_install/gis_compile.sh

but after making PostGIS, someone with sudo will have to
update /etc/ld.so.conf, install PostGIS, and remake MapServer.

And then you'll have to pg_dump and db_load your database using
a new pg_dump format and using the updated db_load script.

  # PostGIS 2.0 doesn't use -E UTF8 but uses a custom dump
  # format, so this pg_dump command may be different from
  # what is familiar to you.

  pg_dump -U cycling \
     -Fc -b -v -f "/ccp/var/dbdumps/ccpv3_demo.pgis20" \
     ccpv3_demo

  # Just in case we screw something up... backup.

  psql -U postgres -d postgres \
    -c "ALTER DATABASE ccpv3_demo RENAME TO ccpv3_demo_pgis15"

  # The updated db_load script does something new for PostGIS 2.x:
  # it creates a new database first, runs a bunch of postgis
  # sql scripts, and then it imports the dump file. In PostGIS
  # 1.x, we only had to call one postgis shell script to handle
  # the import, but in 2.x there's a lot more upfront work to do
  # (which, to the project's credit, allows us more control
  # over what postgis features we choose to load... so maybe
  # now it's possible to make a "leaner" postgis database...
  # not that we care about that, though, since we run on meaty
  # desktops and servers, usually, and not on embedded devices).

  cd /ccp/dev/cp/scripts
  ./db_load.sh /ccp/var/dbdumps/ccpv3_demo.pgis20 ccpv3_demo

=============
CHANGES IN THIS REVISION (it's been a while since the last checkin!):
- Well, it's only been two weeks and a few days change since the 
  last checkin, but it'll sting like thousands of lines of changes...
  and, ideally, I'd break this into twenty separate checkins, but
  there's no time, man! We gotta go Statewide or bust! So, sorry,
  but there are 178 files touched and the svn diff is 23,537 lines long....

Cyclopath Search is Working- And it's Brilliant!
- Lots of enhancements to CcpV1 search, and a ton of bugfixes
  to the earlier CcpV2 implementation attempt (from, like, a year
  or two ago... Long Live CcpV2!).
  - Let's start with the regression bugs:
    - Only one search result was being returned by pyserver.
    - In flashclient, the search query edit box was being
      cleared when the search responce was received (because
      pyserver was not returning the clean query string).
    - When using the search filters, the pageinator total
      record count was not being updated.
  - And then there were bugs from CcpV1:
    - The popup window associated with each search result in
      the list would come up immediately as you moused over,
      but if you were just mousing over to the scroll bar, all
      of a sudden, the scroll bar is obscured. Also, the popup
      doesn't realiably hide itself- it remains on the screen
      if you mouse over to the map. I added more event handlers
      on mouse over and on mouse out and I added a timer to
      delay the popping up and clossing down of the menu.
    - Searching for, e.g., "worthington, minnesota" failed
      because of missing bing entity type, 'PopulatedPlace'.
      Usually, at least in CcpV1, we'd find a matching
      Cyclopath region, but that's dependent on having a
      rich dataset, and for Statewide Cyclopath, I don't
      want to assume that we'll know the answer to every query.
  - If we find an externally geocode result, and if it's an
    address, we can assume that this is exactly what the user wants,
    so we can use this as the center to which to compare all results
    when we're ranking results, rather than using the center of the
    user's viewport. (This is because if the user is searching for an
    address, we can assume they're looking for one specific location,
    whereas if the user is searching for a restaurant, for example,
    we'd want to show all possible results in the user's viewport.)
  - The CcpV2 search fcn. parses the address using lots of
    cool tricks: It uses lookup tables of city and state
    names and zipcodes, and it smartly parses the address
    from the last word to the first word, trying to find,
    progressively from the end of the query string, a zipcode,
    then a state, then a city, and finally the street name.
    - You can now search without specifying the state name,
      and you can also use abbreviations, and you don't always
      need commas. E.g.s:
      - '538 rice st st paul'
      - 'W 50th St and Dupont Ave S Mpls'
      - CcpV2 now decodes the zip code so we can search
        internally and find city regions. E.g., searching
        '55401' will find the Minneapolis region (and even
        rank it nice and high).
    - I fixed how results are ranked so that more meaningful
      results are listed first. I use a mix of values, including:
      - the result of the postgres full text search function,
        ts_rank_cd;
      - for addresses, we can also look for exact names of things,
        e.g., if I search "123 Main St N Mpls", then we can consider
        that something named "Main St N" is probably pretty important;
      - and we still use the item type, like in CcpV1, so that we rank
        regions highest, then byways, and then waypoints;
      - but now we also rank externally geocoded results by their Entity
        Type, and we no longer exclude any externally geocoded results,
        since then we tend to return 0 results for seemingly perfectly
        acceptable queries (Entity Type is specified by the external
        geocoder, and in CcpV1 we exclude all but less than 10% of the
        resulting Entity Types).
  - I fixed the Cyclopath geocoder (used by flashclient when doing a
    route request) to short-circuit return when the external geocoder
    (currently, Bing Maps) finds a confident result (something we believe
    is really what the user wants). This means the geocoder says the
    result is an address, intersection, city, or county, but not any
    other Entity Type.
    - This saves time and we won't annoy the user by returning more than
      one result, which causes flashclient to bug the user and ask them
      to choose one of the results as the route destination.
    - Also, before checking with the external geocoder, we
      search first for an exact Cyclopath name match: if
      the user is routing from, e.g., "gateway fountain",
      we have a point for that. (And we don't have to do any more
      processing, e.g., we don't have to contact the external geocoder.)
  - In CcpV1, the search feature uses Postgres's IN operator.
      e.g., ' '.join(["AND (position(lower(%%s) IN lower(name)))"]
                     * len(self.query_include))
      which means there's one conditional for each search term -- like,
      AND () AND () AND () AND () -- but this is complicated and tedious.
      In CcpV1, the more terms that a user adds, the more restrictive is
      the search! So we're less likely to find items as the search query
      gets more complicated (or, has more words).
    - In CcpV2, we use postgres's "full text search", and we OR terms,
      rather than ANDing them.
    - This means that we find more results for longer queries -- so, rather
      than finding no results, we find more results, but we're also more
      careful to sort results accordingly, so that more relevant results
      are ordered higher.
    - To reduce meaningless hits, I made stop word lookups for each item
      type, e.g., 'ave' is a stop word for byways because so many roads
      have the word 'ave' in their name.
      - The stop words were compiled by counting how often
        certain words are used in item names, or annotation
        comments, etc., and then putting the words that are
        used hundreds of times or more into the stop list.
        - I only searched common street types, like 'ave', 'blvd',
          etc., but a more complete approach would be to make a
          dictionary of all words in all names and then to count
          uses of each of these words... which sounds really
          tedious, but also kind of fun.
  - I created a test script that exercises most of the code paths through
    the new search code. It's in a new directory, scripts/dev/testing/.
    We haven't historically done a good job of testing, so I think search_map_test.sh
    might show how a good test infrastructure might be implemented: by making a
    script that calls ccp.py a lot, and then diff'ing known output from earlier
    runs of the script against nightly runs of the script.

Flashclient Updates
- Relayer map vertices so they are drawn on top of labels,
  otherwise some vertices are obscured by labels and cannot
  be seen (this is especially apparent when splitting byways).
- Fix null ref in trace statement (fortunately, this only affected
  debug builds; i.e., not production code, which doesn't trace).
- Reword the Cyclopath-updated-so-please-reload-flashclient
  msg. to be conciser (it was rather wordy and apologetic).
- After commit, be sure to cleanup deleted byways' old nodes.

Pyserver Fixes
- Problems on import and commit:
  - Again with splitting byways! There was a problem with
    duplicate link_values being created.
    - There was also a problem with the link_value in the
      parent branch having its valid_until_rid being set
      (it should stay at rid_inf because we're not editing
      the parent branch), and with having the parent item
      being marked deleted (rather than the parent item
      being copied to the branch, and then the branch
      item being marked deleted).
  - When making endpoint nodes, we have to normalize the
    elevation to the proper precision (i.e., we can't
    use the whole float, but need to chop it off to
    a decimeter or so).
  - On item delete, the node tables were not being
    maintained properly. Rows weren't being deleted
    from node_byway, so the node_endpoint.reference_n
    wasn't being calculated right.
- Hide some of the more useless MetC branch attributes
  from the flashclient item details panel (like ALT_NAMES,
  LINE_SIDE, etc.).
- Add views for most of the item type tables, so that name
  is joined from item_versioned, access level is grabbed
  from gia table, etc. The new views' names all start with
  an underscore followed by the two-letter item abbreviation.
  E.g., "select * from _by where stk_id = 1234567"
  This is especially useful for debugging links:
    "select * from _lv_an where rhs_stk_id = 1234567"
- load_feats_and_attcs should copy qb.filters instead of
  using a new one, otherwise, e.g., searching using bulk
  stack IDs won't work in some circumstances, because
  it'll have cleared those IDs from the search.
- After import, do like commit.py: tickle Mr. Do! and
  send an interrupt to the route daemon.
- Add the modules from the services/ directory to pyserver_glue,
  so that other scripts that interact with Shapefiles can reuse
  some of the useful code therein (which right now is just some
  debug tracing fcns. that print out stats and info. about a
  specific Shapefile, like attribute definitions, etc.).
- Fix bug trying to submit Revision Feedback: there is no
  default match in the new item policy table for a link_value
  between an attachment and an attribute.
- Fix a problem calculating route reaction likes and dislikes.
- Add __eq__ and __ne__ fcns. to item_base so we can compare
  node_endpoints (well, any item type, but it's needed for
  node_endpoints).
- grac_record was not initializing acl_grouping in the version
  finalize fcn.
...
- Ug, I hid the route reaction panel, because we disabled
  that experiment last December... so this whole time the
  panel has been visible and you can read old route reactions,
  but you cannot make any new reactions! (We are a solly lot!)

Statewide Changes
- Add two bike facilities for greatermn project (our client
  asked for it): 'U.S. Bike Route' and 'State Bikeway'.
  (Though we still need to figure out ornamentation, like color).

Changes to scripts/ Scripts
- When running schema-upgrade from command line, don't vacuum
  after every script, but ask user if they want to vacuum after
  all scripts have run (vacuuming is rarely necessary between
  scripts, and it takes a number of minutes).
  - Also fix another bug in schema-upgrade: it was failing for
    me because I have the so-called "lite" database, with just
    the minnesota schema, and missing colorado, but the latter
    schema is listed in the upgrade_event table, which schema-
    upgrade parses.
- In the auto_install scripts, I removed all the /export/scratch/
  prefixes since /ccp/ should always exist, and /ccp/var on the
  production server is mapped to another hard drive,
  /export/scratch2. Basically, /export/scratch is too hard of
  a path, should let's stick with something a little mo' symbolic.

Item Watching
- New item watching cron job -- it will run every minute and
  will email users about revision, thread/post, and item activity.
  - Reworked the spam module to share its email fcn. (the one
    that sends multipart emails and not just plain old text)
    with the cron job, so now there's a common fcn. to call
    to send an email. No more copy-n-pasted email code all over
    the place.
  - On commit, rather than emailing users immediately, the
    proper item alerts are created and stored in the new
    item_event_alert table. (Really, I didn't like that
    one user's HTTP request was hanging while pyserver
    was emailing other users: we can complete the waiting
    users's HTTP request and *then* email other users.)
- More updates to item_event_alert table to support new
  cron job for emailing users.
  - Also add option for users to choose to watch their
    saved revisions: in CcpV1, we automatically emailed
    any user whose revision was reverted or commented upon,
    but now we can let the user choose if they care for
    this correspondence.
- When sending item watcher emails, we now add an opt-out
  link, like the new opt-out command for user emails:
  item watcher emails include a link to a similar command,
  user_nowatchers, that'll disable all of a user's item
  watchers -- so users can disable all of their watchers
  using a link from an item watcher email.

Upgrade to PostGIS 2.0.4!!
- Unfortunately, we cannot upgrade to PostGIS 2.1 until we
  upgrade from Postgres 8.4 to at least 9.1, but...
- But... PostGIS 2.0 is a big step!
- PostGIS 1.5 was working well, but 2.0 has lots of improvements,
  including to projections, and in the updated search feature; we
  now geocode external lon,lat results, so, hey, that's working
  for us.
- We're also ready to jump to Postgres 9.1/2/3 whenever, and
  we work with all of the latest versions of GEOS, GDAL, Proj.4,
  etc. (I updated and tested the gis_compile auto_install script,
  and we're good to go with all of the latest GIS libraries that
  we use and love so much.)

DEVS: There's a new schema script.
  cd /ccp/dev/cp/scripts
  ./schema-upgrade.py {your_db_name}

- Flashclient: Problem when using split tool while
  byway is still lazy-loading. The tool would send
  GWIS supplemental requests, but some were duplicates
  that were being ignored. So update_supplemental now
  returns an indication if the request was actually
  queued.
  - The widget was waiting forever for GWIS requests
    that were never sent.
- Flashclient regression: Item ratings were not
  being sent- the code was using an uninitialized variable
  in GWIS_Commit: the var had been renamed but old the
  declaration hadn't been deleted and there was still a
  reference, so, kind of like a typo and kind of like a
  copy-n-paste (or copy-n-delete) mistake.
- Flashclient regression: Rating and Watching _new_ (fresh)
  items should be added to the working copy and committed
  when the map is saved. There were unintentionally being
  sent immediately for new, unsaved items (since rating
  and watching was made into an out-of-band commit). Now,
  rating and watching existing items is still an immediate
  GWIS commit, but rating and watching new items is queued
  to the map save data.
- Flashclient: When the Name widget was in editing mode,
  it was causing the Stack ID not to be shown in the header.
- Pyserver: Fix problem computing access_infer_id. 1., So
  that split-into link_values, which are fetched userlessly,
  are assigned the proper bitmask. And, 2., To remove
  ambiguity about whom usr_editor and usr_arbiter apply,
  since they're calculated in the context of the user who
  is saving; i.e., the usr_* bit values don't make sense
  for 'permissive'-style item, which allow more than one
  user to be arbiter, and for 'restricted'-style items,
  which users other than the arbiter can edit. E.g., when
  a non-arbiter user would save, the access_infer_id would
  be mis-calculated (by removing the usr_arbiter bit),
  because the user saving has editor access but not
  arbiter access.
- Pyserver: I noticed that the same thread is used by
  overlapping apache requests, so it was not possible
  to trace the same apache requests in the log file.
  So in gwis_mod_python, which is the entry point for
  apache requests, I pass the apache request object to
  the logging facility so it can include the unique
  connection ID. Now, it's possible to trace the same
  request in the log file and to differentiate unique
  connections' log messages from other, overlapping
  requests' messages.
- Pyserver: Big Problems with locks:
  - We need a longer timeout, especially for developer
    machines. I added a timeout to conf that's similar
    to flashclient's client timeout: that is, we want
    the gwis request to timeout before the client, so
    at least the server can send back an error before
    the client timesout.
  - When a SQL table or row lock timedout, we were missing
    the error, 1., because db_glue was intercepting the
    exception and throwing a different error (for another
    reason), and 2., because some of the try/except blocks
    were ordered wrong, and a base class exception was
    catching the exception before the derived class
    handler.
    - Now, callers tell the sql() fcn. to raise the
      original exception; and the caller reordered its
      except blocks so the derived class comes first.
- MetC Shapefile: It truncates names to 44 chars (the
  width of the field) so check for this and restore the
  original byway's name if so.
- To revision table, add a new column which indicates how
  long the 'revision' table lock was held to complete the
  revision. This helps give context to the revision and
  may help fix problems with slow commits and imports.
- Pyserver: Problem with duplicate split-into link_values.
  When splitting a byway, byway was making new link_values,
  and then commit was making new ones based on the GML.
  - I added code in commit to just overwrite the newly
    created link_value record when processing GML link_values
    for newly split byways' link_values.
  - I also added code to link_value to check for duplicate
    link_values (same lhs_stack_id and same rhs_stack_id)
    when the lhs item is not an attribute that indicates
    multiple_allowed.
- A bunch of fixes to the import script, which was broken by
  recent changes to splitting byways and making link_values.

DEVS: There's a new schema script.
  cd /ccp/dev/cp/scripts
  ./schema-upgrade.py {your_db_name}

Bugfixes:
- Regression: Splitting byway and making new intersection
  is broken. The node_endpoint class needs to set acl_grouping
  to 1, and the byway class was not assigning new split-from
  link_values' client stack IDs correctly.
- Change flashclient name header to default to an edit box when
  the user is in edit mode, rather than user having to double-
  click on the name.
- For private routes with a Web link, the deep-link URL should
  require the user to log in, so I added a new deep-link,
  'private', that asks users to log on before fetching the
  deep-linked item.
  - Before this, making a Web link on a private route didn't
    work if the user used the link after logging off.
- Add user_ column, unsubscribe_proof, which is an UUID we can
  use with the new user_unsubscribe command so users can opt-out
  of emails without having to email us and us having to manually
  update the database.
  - I added an htmlfile_out attribute to the request object,
  since the new GWIS command needs to return HTML, rather than
  XML.
  - See: http://bugs.cyclopath.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2098
- Fixed problems trying to lock database rows and using NOWAIT:
  When the server is busy, it seems to not ever be able to lock
  rows.
  - We now use SET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT to set a timeout of a few
  seconds. The default is to wait forever, but we want to not
  wait longer than the HTTP timeout.

Argh, when I fixed the user__token problem I broke mobile!
  - At least I think so: it looks like mobile is sending
    its own token. In contrast, flashclient doesn't generate
    tokens but requests them from the server. This ensures
    that tokens are unique, and it helps prevent against
    spoofing users, since, in CcpV1, a user's token never
    changes... like, not even when they log out, which
    makes the token more vulnerable than a session-based
    token.

- Route editing fixes.
  - Wasn't splicing the new sub-segment correctly.
  - Wasn't updating the directions and route details
    tabs.
  - Wasn't recalculating the route length.
  - Route_List has same Flex scrolling problem as
    Text, so I added one more row to the list than
    their are number of route_stops, so the scrolling
    problem doesn't happen (as opposed to overriding
    the DataGrid object, which seems like a waste of
    time and possibly a fruitless effort).
  - Dragging the route was broken: clicking on the route
    (on the temporary route_stop that tracks the cursor
    as a user mouses over a route line) to create a new
    route stop and drag it to another intersection was
    broken. There were a handful of issues.
    - Same with using the New Destination button in the
      panel, which then lets you click on the map. The
      tool was broken.
- Getting GPX on anon. route was not working because
  session ID was not being used.
- Fix item alerts panel: was not showing fetched alerts
  (a regression error: untested new code from a fix to
   an earlier bug...).
- Fix Route History's Clear All (discrepancies between
  client and server GWIS protocol implementation).
- Fix two "warning: unable to bind to property" properties,

  and 'waypoint', but gwis v3 was using 'rstep' and 'rstop';
  I just reverted to the wfs v1 convention (CcpV1).
- Fix bug saving routes: new route stops were not being
  saved in the database.
- Fix MediaWiki new user plugin:

  - MediaWiki converts spaces in usernames to underscores.
  - We've never handled this case, nor has any user ever

  - Show bike facilities.
  - Highlight items with notes or discussions.
  - Shade roads by their rating.

- Implement Access_Infer.sessid_arbiter so we don't set
  Access_Infer.others_arbiter instead. This helps anon
  users request routes, log in, and then save the routes.
- Also fix the footer text about saving to handle the
  different states better (and print more relevant text).
- Check for DisabledListItemRenderer null object reference
  and print stack trace -- I saw this earlier but wasn't
  able to reproduce it.
- MediaWiki CycloAuth.php fixes:
  - We don't have a test mediawiki server, so it's hard
    to test except just going live and testing...
  - Checking for underscore as the first character
    needs to be doubly-escaped, since PHP escapes
    the slash, and then postgres escapes it.
  - Now setting search_path, because cp_user_new
    needs it. So now I've hard-coded 'minnesota'.
- Fix creating stealth secret (deep link) for anon
  user routes.
- Also fix problem saving new group_item_access rows:
  the session_id was not being recorded in the new rows.
- Catch IOError in setup_areq: in self.areq.read(),
  it looks like the client has disconnected.
- Fix email script reference to emailx (it's now user_mail).
- Fix route editing: add CcpV1's nosave (dont_save) to
  tell route finder not to save route request (when getting
  sub-segment routes).
  - Also don't add sub-segments to Geofeature.all or map.
  - Change Route's Route_Stops from Sprites to Item_Sprites,
    so when they're clicked, we know to which Route they
    belong.
- Fix refreshing anon-fetched routes after logging in:
  do similar to stealth_create and use commit to update
  GIA records (route_get was just doing SQL directly,
  but that's not good enough).

- Glaring type (missing opening paranthesis) in import_items_ccp,
  called via daily cron when exporting branches.
- Fixes to committing permissions changes for restricted item types,
  e.g., saving changes to route permissions.
  - In pyserver commit, when we fetch items that are not being
    edited but are instead having permissions changed, or are being
    rated, etc., we should peek in the group_item_access table to
    figure out the item_type, so that we hydrate a proper item, e.g.,
    a route.One, instead of the parent class, item_user_access.One.
    - If we don't do this, for permissions changes, the item_type_id
      column will be recorded incorrectly.
  - Fix a problem in grac_manager asserting when called by commit
    when incrementing acl_grouping, i.e., changing an item's permissions
    without creating a new revision. The grac_mgr now has an
    "allow_existing" option, since the item will have an incremented
    acl_grouping, but its version will be the same.
  - Also fix commit to call item_mgr.start_new_revision rather than
    trying to sneakily do it itself.
- Fix route.One to allow 'source' to be specified by flashclient
  via GML.
- Fix problem deleting route -- route_steps were not being assigned
  byway_id.
- Fix group_item_access.One.sql_context_user, which is not used but
  can be called via ./ccp.py -r -t group_item_access -x user -I {stk_id}
- Don't call save_core when just incrementing acl_grouping, but do
  call save_related_maybe.
- Add dirty_reason_infr to indicate when item_stack.access_infer needs
  to be updated.

DEVS:
 UPDATE group_ SET access_scope_id = cp_access_scope_id('public')
 WHERE access_scope_id = cp_access_scope_id('shared')
       AND name = 'Stealth-Secret Group';

- Change Stealth Secret Group from shared to public, so flashclient
  can determine the stealth secret group stack ID, which it uses to
  determine a route's permissions and visibilities.
  - Also modified pyserver to send the steatch secret group id with
    a user's group_membership records, and modified flashclient to
    consume the group id.
- In mapserver/tilecache_update.py, two bugs:
  - Incorrent indent (typo) causes --bbox option to fail.
  - When making the segment cache, we need to load byways
    with heavyweight=True so we get ratings, tags, and attrs.
- Pyserver: search_by_stack_id should use qb.filters.only_stack_ids
  instead of directly injecting SQL, otherwise qb.filters.get_id_count
  doesn't work.
- Exchange MAGIC_NUMBERs in pyserver with correct values from
  Library_Squelch class (pyserver was creating item_findability
  records with the wrong enum value, which is why using a class
  reference rather than hard-coding numbers in code is the way to go).
- Many miscellaneous bugfixes to route saving and sharing widgets.

- Fixed Deep_Link.LOGGED_IN: with a deep link that requires authentication,
  the deep link was executing right before the Update_User started, so the
  GWIS request for the route sent by the deep link was being discarded as
  soon as flashclient started reloading the map for the logged-in user.
  - I deferred reacting to LOGGED_IN until updatedItems is dispatched.
- Lots of fixes (well, three in pyserver, and one or two in flashclient) to
  item_findability_put. The code was pretty green and not tested well,
  because other problems had to be solved before said code could be tested.
  I haven't tested changing library visibilty, but the history_add action
  seems to be working now.
- Route.set_selected had an error: it was testing this.selected
  after calling super.set_selected, so this.selected was changed.
  This caused problems selecting routes when switching to
  their details panel, e.g., when deep linking to a route or
  double-clicking one in a route list, the route would not
  get selected on the map.
- In flashclient, out-of-band requests no longer start the throbberer.
  E.g., when switching to a route panel, the user triggers a
  findability-put command, but we shouldn't annoy/confuse (annoy-confuse?)
  the user with the "Working..." throbberer.

Flashclient:
- Typo in route_select (or, more accurately, a cut-n-paste
  error) was causing route_select to have route_lookat called
  on ensure_hydrated callback. Meaning, if the route wasn't
  loaded, it would be lazy-loaded first, but the wrong callback
  was being called: lookat instead of select.
- Byway was not clearing one-way arrows when deselected.
Pyserver:
- Error looking up existing tags by name: was just using
  item_versioned table without bothering to join on the tag table.
  - This was causing a problem adding tags whose name is
    the name of other, non-tag items in the system, like 'test'.

Flashclient:
- Some GWIS callbacks were processing resp_items without
  checking to see if the items already exist.
  - E.g., when deep-linking to a route, we've already
    loaded the route list, and then we request the deep-
    linked route, but the deep-link callback uses the
    newly created item from the GWIS response. Instead,
    it should check Geofeature.all and use the existing
    item (after calling route.init(G.item_mgr) to update
    the existing item, since we're getting route steps,
    route stops, and lazy-loading item_values).
  - Deep Link is fixed to always check the item's class's
    item lookup for the resident item.
- Deep Link also fixed to activate route panel.
  - The route was being selected, but solo=false, so the
    route was just attaching itself to the route-list panel,
    rather than opening a route details panel.
- I did a Big No-No: I used ||= to try to run a function
  that I always want to run, but stupidly overlooked the
  fact that ||= only runs the right-hand side if the left-
  hand side is false. Specifically, I set a Boolean first
  to the Boolean output of a function, and then I wanted
  to run a second function and OR the results together.
  But I need to use an intermediate variable, since ||=
  is So Smart.
  - This fixes the problem with pan_and_zoom_to where
    the map pans but does not zoom (since zooming was
    the second operation that ||= skipped).
- When adding or deleting tags, the tag widget list was
  not updating.
  - I had recently modified the tag widget list to update
    only when necessary, otherwise there's this annoying
    screen flicker.
    - But I guess I was too restrictive, or didn't code
      for all circumstances... so hopefully this is the
      last regression caused by trying to get rid of the
      annoying screen flicker.
- Bugfix for anonymous route request, which was complaining
  "requires loggin in": We shouldn't request the findability
  of an unsaved route, since it has no findability record.
- Funny Flex Behaviour (I.E., Flex Bug Fixed):
  If you use the mouse wheel over a Text element with
  a scrolling Container, you'll scroll both the container
  and one line of the Text -- meaning, the first line
  of the Text field disappears! This is super funny.
  I found a blog post with a simple class that overrides
  Flex's Text class that fixes this... silly issue.
- Statewide updates:
  - I added all (of the overly loquacious) help text for
    the bike facilities (which you'll find in the map
    legend).
  - I renamed the bike facility classes and some of the
    lookup keys to reflect the changes what we decided
    at the MnDOT meeting a few weeks back.
  - I moved the checkbox-taggers to below the bike
    facilities and cautions dropdowns, removed the
    'unpaved' option, and added a few more. Now it's
    four checkboxes: Busy, Closed, Planned, Rumbles.
    - FIXME: The checkbox-taggers are not implemented;
      toggling the checkbox will eventually add or
      remove the corresponding tag.
Pyserver:
- A few problems when saving newly created or deleted
  link_values.
  - link_value.py missing one fcn. override, and also
    missing the last parm of another fcn. override.
- Bugfix: When making new items, checking stack_id < 0
  must also check stack_id is not None.
- Change SQLs' "AS foo" to a unique name for each call,
  to make debugging easier.
- Bugfix: Typo on SQL when fetching item_findability.
Wire the new bike facility skin styles into the mapserver mapfile.
 - Incorporates color and style changes decided at the recent
   MnDOT meeting.
 - This is obviously untested, 'natch, since the upgrade scripts
   are currently running on the production server and I'm scrambling
   to get all this awesome code out... so I expect to be checking
   in bugfixes to the mapfile once the check_cache_now.sh runs.

===========================
DEVS: Update your database:

 UPDATE item_findability SET library_squelch = library_squelch + 1;
===========================

- Lots of bugfixes to route_list and route_list_entry.
  - The route_list in the route library and the user's
    recent routes list was very much broken.
  - In CcpV1, each Route_List_Entry has a checkbox,
    a 'lookat' button, and a 'more' button. Toggling
    the checkbox shows or hides a route path on the map;
    using the 'lookat' button zooms and pans to the route,
    and the 'more' button changes the sole CcpV1 item details
    panel to the chosen route.
  - What's new in this revision:
    - The Panel_Routes_Box's Detail_Panel_Base (which owns the
      route library and the user's last viewed list) did not
      specify a shows_type, so Routes could not be attached
      to its selection set.
    - Clicking on a Route_List_Entry hydrates the route (loads
      its route_steps, route_stops, and link_values), zooms and
      pans to the route, and shows the route on the map.
      - In CcpV1, a random route visualization is chosen unless
        the user is logged in and their last-used-route-viz cookie
        is set.
        - Using a random visualization for anonymous users is
          confusing, since the user has to discover what the
          different colors mean. It makes more sense to just
          default to the boring, solid color visualization.
        - In CcpV2, we default to the 'normal', boring route
          visualization.
        - Since CcpV2 supports multiple panels, the user can open
          multiple routes simultaneously and choose different
          visualizations for each route, using the dropdown
          visualization widget on each route's panel.
          - On the map, the user will see unique visualizations for
            each route.
    - The 'lookat' button triggers a zoom and pan. I already had CcpV2
      working to ignore non-zoom zooms (i.e., if zoom-to and zoom-from are
      equal), but I guess I didn't do the same for pan. So clicking the
      'lookat' button was triggering a GWIS request and the 'Working...'
      throbberer was showing its face. So I fixed pan such that the map
      does a no-op if the pan's x and y deltas are both 0.
    - Added a double-click handler on Route_List_Entry that opens the route
      panel and selects the route.
      - Both click handlers now ignore clicks on the other widgets using a
        lookup of the widgets to ignore (i.e., the 'lookat' button, the
        show-on-map checkbox, etc.). Previously, the single click handler
        simply ignored the click if it was on a Button. Now we can ignore
        the 'locked' icon, the checkbox, and whatever other children we want.
      - I set the locked icon to not includeInLayout if it's not visible,
        which causes the origin-destination text to left-justify, which
        looks sooo much better.
    - Mouse-over and mouse-out are now utilized to highlight the route, which
      gives the one route that you're hovering over in the list to have a
      border around it on the map, making it distinguishable from the other
      routes.
      - You can also mouse-over routes when looking at another route's
        details panel, and the route under the mouse will be highlighted,
        and its route_stops drawn.
  - On the route details panel, unless you were in editing mode, the route
    visualization dropdown had no effect. This was also affecting the new
    mouse-over behavior in the route library.
    - For whatever reason, Route.as was only drawing the visualization if
      the client was in editing mode.
    - In CcpV1, there's one route visualization for all routes (whatever was
      last selected in the route details panel). Now, each route remembers its
      own route visualization, which is used to draw the route, regardless of
      editing mode.
    - (But we don't draw the draggable route stuff unless in editing mode...
       which we may have to rethink, since editing and saving routes is not
       what we mean by edit mode: routes are editable and saveable regardless
       of whether or not the user hits the 'Editing' button.)
  - Compilation was often failing because of spaghetti
    code in route_list_entry that referenced a long chain
    of objects, e.g., G.app.blah.blah.blah, I mean,
    G.app.routes_panel.routes_library.search_routes; I replaced
    this mechanism with an event that route_list dispatches,
    and on which the owning parent panel listens, and now compilation
    doesn't sometimes mysteriously fail on this code.
  - Fixed problem with route_stop labels being drawn beneath the route
    stop circle.
- After a great meeting with the client, I'm starting to implement
  some changes to the Bike Facility and Cautions widgets, and related
  widgets that the traffic planners will use.
  - I started adding help hints to each bike facility in the help panel
    in the map legend. We need it to be easy for editors to decide or
    to determine what bike facility to apply to road segments.
- Silly error: overriders of set_selected were not passing the
  third param, solo, to the super!
- Item_Versioned.rev_is_working now checks if Follow, so that
  Current is allowed, and not just Working, since even when
  editing, individual items generally use the Current rev.
- When changing a panel's items_selected, don't deselect items
  unless the panel is the active panel, otherwise the items are
  considered selected by the panel that's about to become the
  active panel.
  - Same goes for panel_selection_clear.
- The annotation widget autocomplete box was not populating and
  showing properly.
- Fix problem changing to historic or diff mode: disable the Editing
  button (otherwise, flashclient asserts if you click Editing
  while in historic mode).
  - Also cleanup History_Manager so it doesn't do anything more
    than just manage the hazy map border and the revision label.
- Fixes to getting new routes:
  - Enum-ified the library_squelch constants, so we can remove
    magic numbers from the code.
  - Fixed GWIS_Route_Get_New to lazy-load the route once it's fetched.
    - I fixed lazy-loading to wait on the item_stack and item_findability
      data first before firing the linksLoaded events, otherwise the route
      panel doesn't know enough about the route to decide to draw the
      save-route widgets.

- Bugfix (ug: _Major_ Bugfix): Wrong Client IDs issued during
  commit (or, rather, the same client ID being used for
  disparate items being saved).
  - pyserver's qb.item_mgr was starting with client ID
    -1, which is fine, except it wasn't being changed
    after loading items from the client. Since flashclient
    also sends client IDs, after pyserver's commit hydrates
    items from GML, it needs to reset item_mgr.next_client_id
    accordingly (i.e., to one less than the lowest client ID
    referenced in the GML).
- Branchy Bugfix: Unknown node_endpoint data being joined.
  - When fetching byways, we need to filter on the revision
    IDs (valid_start_rid and valid_until_rid) and the
    branch_id. The old code was loosely joining using just the
    stack ID of the nodes, so it was picking up node_endpoints
    of all versions and from all branches (albeit, sharing the
    same stack_id, but whatever, you don't know what record you
    get after the "select distinct" is applied).
- Branchy Bugfix: Incorrect byway_rating sent for branchy byways.
  - Ug, another tedious solution: We have to make rows in
    byway_rating in each branch for every byway in the parent
    branches.
    - See the new upgrade script, byway_ratings_populate.py.
  - This is similar to the node_endpoint problem: even though
    our branches are technically "stacked" branches -- meaning,
    we don't have to duplicate data in the branch that hasn't
    been modified, i.e., when you make a new branch, you don't
    clone a single byway -- we still have to make rows for
    every node_endpoint and every byway_rating...
- New flashclient widget for node endpoints.
  - Eventually, users will be able to edit node endpoints:
    - To change a node's elevation;
    - To look for and fix connectivity issues by examining
      dangles, and either marking the dangle "okay" (meaning,
      the dangle represents a dead-end in the network), or by
      fixing the dangle and connecting the node to the network.
    - But for now, the new widget is to help developers debug:
      - I've been using the widget to get at the node endpoint
        stack IDs, so I can poke around in the database and
        verify that data is being saved correctly... which is
        how I discovered some of the aforementioned bugs.
- In pyserver, generic_rating was being declared int, but it's real.
- Bugfix: flashclient was creating new stack_ids for every drag
          event. This was supposedly recently fixed... so maybe
          this is a regression.
  - move_do was not correctly resolving the vertex index when
    calling node_endpoint_update.
- Change lowest rating label from "impassable" to "avoid"...
  Let's think about this more, but impassable isn't a rating or
  sentiment, it's a fact; telling the system to avoid a segment
  makes more sense, I think.
- Add union() operator to Set_UUID.
- Bugfix/annoyance: when switching branches, flashclient was
  always warning you that there were unsaved changes, even when
  not.
- In pyserver, fixed some problems related to re-hydrating an
  item's link_values. Specifically, the new_item_cache was not
  being cleaned up when an item's link_values were overwritten.

- Bugix to newish schema upgrade scripts (it's been
  a while since the scripts have been run, since
  runic was offline for much of the summer...).
- Tweak gwis_error to not include None in the
  hint dictionary set (mostly cosmetic).
- Bugfix: Create a new byway, then split it and
  save it; pyserver does not expect a client ID as
  split_from_stack_id.
  - I fixed flashclient to not send client IDs as
    split-from IDs, and I fixed pyserver to not assert
    but to make a new gwis_error instead.
  - Bugfix: Fixed scope of return variable in commit's
    process_item_hydrated -- it was discovered by the
    previous error caused by client split_from_stack_id.
    The return value was being declared in if block, so
    the else path resulted in no defined return value...
- Bugfix: In flashclient, if you create a new byway,
  save it, then select it, flashclient would lazy-load
  the byway at the previous revision (i.e., one revision
  before the new revision at which the new byway was
  saved).
  - I changed the assert in access_style_results_load
    to log warnings and bail instead, if the server does
    not return an item_stack record.
  - When the Commit Command response is being processed,
    flashclient now bumps its rev_working to the latest
    revision.
    - If the difference in revisions is more than 1, it
      means there were other changes than just the user's
      commit. Since flashclient doesn't implement an Update
      revision, like pyserver, and using a Diff checkout
      to update flashclient's working checkout sounds like
      an unwired nightmare, I opted to force a full discard-
      and-reload if jumping more than just one revision.
- When making a new Command in flashclient, if the
  command detects a problem trying to initialize, it
  can mark itself pre-canceled, such that the caller
  can still try to execute the command and we'll just
  bark at the user.
  - I had a problem with Style Change being unset but
    being marked dirty, and Commit trying to add its
    XML subdoc. I fixed the Style Change problem (see
    next bugfix), but also made Commit more robust, so
    that now errors can be handled in the constructor.
- Bugfix: Differentiate between types of item cloning.
  - The same clone fcn. is being used to
    a) update items already in memory with the latest
       GML (XML) from the server; and
    b) make a new item by copying an existing item.
  - In the latter case, b), we shouldn't copy
    access_level_id, otherwise the grac_manager doesn't
    bother calculating and setting access_scope_id.

More Flashclient map editing bugfixes:
- When deleting geofeatures and attachments, do
  not also delete link_values (or make sure you
  re-add them when said items are un-deleted).
  - I went with the don't-delete option, to make
    it easy to fix, e.g., byway split undo: if
    you undo the split, the link_values were not
    re-added, so the undone byway was actually
    missing all of its link_values.
- If not loose_selection_set and reusing a details
  panel, make sure to de-select whatever items are
  not part of the new selection set before overwriting
  a panel's items_selected/feats_selected.
  - Otherwise, e.g., if you make an intersection, which
    selects two roads, and then split one of the roads,
    the non-split road remains selected on the map even
    though the item is no longer part of the details panel
    selection.
- Bug in Attribute.consensus: wasn't using on_empty when
  calling Attribute.consensus_one for second and subsequent
  items (so the consensus was sometimes null when multiple
  items were selected).
- Another fix to the advanced tool palette.
Pyserver bugfixes:
- Typo in commit.py when processing split byways.
- Send new max_rid in commit response.

- Fix regression: create a point, then create a byway,
  and the byway is added to the point panel.
- Fix CcpV1 editing tools behavioral problems:
  - When you open the dropdown, if you click on the map,
    the dropdown should close but the tool should not
    execute. E.g., if you have the create new point tool
    active and open the advanced tool dropdown, if you then
    click on the map, only the dropdown should close; a new
    point should not be created.
    - The same logic also applies if you open the dropdown
      and then click on Undo, Redo, Save Map, or Discard
      Changes.
  - The keyboard shortcuts for selecting tools was broken
    if the tool palette had focus. (Rather than letting the
    owning Combo_Box_V2 process the keypress, we need to have
    the map process the keypress.)
  - If you click on the already-selected tool in the advanced
    dropdown, that tool was not being activated, e.g., if you
    had the pan tool active and choose whatever was selected
    in the dropdown, the active tool was not changed to the
    chosen advanced tool.
  - While you could use the Tab key to find the dropdown, and
    you could use the up and down arrows to change the selected
    item in the list of advanced tools, there was no way to
    activate the selected tool. Now you can press space to
    activate the tool, just like you can do if you tab to
    the pan-select or new-point tool.
- Fix error in Combo_Box_V2: internal_dropdown_factory.properties
  were being inadvertently overwritten.

  Thanks for the bugfix, Stephanie!
    http://bugs.cyclopath.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2806
- I also fixed Byway_Vertex_Move not to select all
  byways being edited. E.g., if you have one byway
  selected and then drag an intersection, the tool
  should not select all the other byways attached
  to that intersection.
- New Region Tool was crashing; it's on_mouse_down now
  reads pretty much like the new point tool's, and some-
  what like the new byway tool's.
  - Also fixed CcpV1 Bug 1736, which indicates that the
    new region tool does not work like the new point
    and new byway tool because new regions cannot
    be dragged. Now new regions can be dragged while
    the mouse is held down.
    http://bugs.cyclopath.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1736
- Branch panel was asserting when showing because
  of over-assertive behaviour in Branch.set_selected.
- On branch change, with unsaved changes, user was
  not being asked to save (and dirty items were
  correctly triggering an assert in item_discard).
- Silly error swiching modes with no tags selected,
  and Widget_Tag_List.repopulate failing.
- For the custom attr widgets, Bike Facility and Bike
  Caution, if the default value is not set and editing
  mode is not enabled, the widget is now hidden.
- Fix Attribute-Link_Value edit control (the one
  on the attribute list with the edit text box,
  e.g., Bicycle Route Name).
  - The text field was incorrectly wired to the
    set of selected geofeatures, but we really
    need a set of link_values (and we make new
    link_values as needed).
  - The Text_Field_Editable class needs to supply
    the command object with the old text and a handle
    to itself so that undo/redo work right (so that,
    e.g., on undo and redo, the text in the edit
    field changes).
- Add a new topic to the map legend: editing hints.
  - Even I didn't remember how to test Vertex_Delete
    (hint: select a vertex with your mouse and then
     use the backspace or delete key on your keyboard).

DEVS: I edited a schema script; you can wait for the next db,
      or you can run, e.g.:
  psql -U cycling ccpv3_demo < scripts/schema/209-geofeat_lyr_majortrail.sql

Flashclient details panel flicker problem:
  - For a number of the widgets, I added listeners on
  selectedsetChanged so that widgets don't have to
  blindly reset themselves whenever repopulate is
  called.
  - This fixes a problem, e.g., when you edit an
  item on the details panel, _all_ widgets temporarily
  disappear and then reappear. This is very annoying
  if you're editing one of the attribute steppers,
  because it disappears, the vertical scroll bar
  disappears, and then everything is redrawn.

- Fix Flashclient undo/redo problem maintaining dirty
  flags. Command_Base was only remembering one dirty flag,
  but it should remember all flags for each item (I saw a
  problem with Dirty_Reason.item_schg being forgotten).
- Deprecate group_item_access.item_layer, which is
  not used by any features (the value is not maintained
  by group_item_access so I removed it from the table).
Add new tag problems:
- If you undo the new tag, you cannot re-add the same
  tag, because the item.tagged lookup still contained
  the tag.
  - The solution was more general: I fixed a problem
    when deleting link_values, so that an item's tagged
    and attrs get updated.
- When you add a new tag, the tag was not being added
  to the autocomplete list. So, e.g., if I wanted to
  add the tag to another geofeature I selected, I'd
  have to re-type it since it wouldn't show up in the
  list.
- On undo, then redo, was not un-deleting the
  attachment, so the tag was not getting applied
  (since the link_value couldn't find the attachment).
Flashclient issues logging on and off:
- When you log on, there were errors due to trying
  to preserve edited items (on log on, you can
  keep your edits without having to save; on log
  out, you have to save or discard before logging
  off).
- Also when you log on, all item panels were being
  closed and then the recent changes was being
  activated.
  - I changed it so that the find route panel is
    activated instead, which feels a lot more
    natural (it's the first panel you see when
    you log on, duh).
  - I also did something neat: if you have an item
    or items selected with you log on, those item(s)
    are re-selected, which creates, populates, and
    activates the item's panel.
    - This actually only works for selected geofeatures
      in the viewport; we could open a Bug nnnn for when
      items are not loaded automatically (so, on log on,
      we checkout stack IDs of the items that were selected,
      since, e.g., notes are only loaded when a geofeature
      to which they're attached is selected), and we could
      also maybe preserve other item tabs that were open.
      But that seems like a lot of work for very little
      benefit...
Pyserver and script fixes:
- Pyserver bug: not setting access_style_id correctly.
  - When an anoymous user saved a pub_choice item or a
    logged on user saved a usr_choice item, pyserver
    was not changing access_style_id from *_choice to
    *_editor... so the wrong access_style_id value was
    saved in item_stack. (The problem manifested itself
    in flashclient, as I noticed I could not delete
    new items that I had created, but I could edit
    them!)
- Pyserver bug: when deleting an item, if item was
  already deleted or cannot be found, don't keep
  running the delete fcn. I made commit.py's
  process_item_hydrated return a success bool so
  mark_deleted can short circuit.
  - I also fixed the ordering of deleting the geofeature
    and its link_values -- you cannot delete the geofeature
    until after you delete the links, otherwise the links
    are confused because the geofeature is already deleted.
- Update emails_for_spam.py to ref. correct ccpdev location.
- Update emails_for_spam.py to look for and to cull duplicate
  user IDs (so we don't email the same person multiple times!).
- Fix minimum value of /byway/shoulder_width, which should be
  0, not -1 (unless -1 was suppose to mean something special...).
- Set custom-control bit for un-implemented attrs so they don't
  show up in the byway attributes list (/byway/cycle_route and
  /byway/no_access).
- Add 'Alley' byway layer type.

More flashclient map editing bug fixes:
- The mouse listeners for new byways were not being added
  correctly (so, e.g., mouse-over did not trigger connectivity
  highlights). I moved the addEventListener from the Geofeature's
  constructor to the init_add fcn., so that an item can be removed
  from the map but also re-added later (which is how commands' undoes
  and redoes work).
- Each item's 'set deleted' used to remove the item
  from the class's .all lookup, but that's no longer
  the case: the item_cleanup fcn. (called via item_discard)
  should handle the .all lookup (like how init_add handles
  adding items to the lookup); set deleted is only about
  the map's deletedset, and isn't about the item lookups.
- On init_add, check if item was previously added.
- During do/undo command stack walking, some commands
  were leaving byway vertices selected on the map,
  sometimes without even a byway to go along with 
  the vertices. Turns out the Geofeature fcn. to
  enable vertices was blindly overwriting the existing
  vertices collection, so we were orphaning vertices on
  the map.
  - I also hardened vertex_init to call vertex_unit if
    it is about to overwrite an existing vertex (though
    this step is redundant if vertices_activate does its
    job).
- Make sure new ('invalid') Geofeatures (whose stack_ids
  are 0) get discarded from the map prior to being assigned
  client stack_ids, otherwise their goo is leftover in the
  item class lookups and confusion ensues.
- Fix yet another problem making new itersection: after
  undo or redo, not all the byways that should be selected
  were selected, and there were remnants of deleted byways,
  or byways were drawn without their wide roadway sprites
  but instead just the thin blue centerlines.
- For Vertex_Move command, I had previously modified it
  to maintain a loose selection set, but on undo and redo,
  the selection set should be strictly the byway that was
  moved (otherwise it seems silly to keep other byways
  selected, because it's not obvious what undo/redo did)
  so I modified Command_Base.activate_appropriate_panel
  to accept a Boolean, loose_selection_set, to override the
  class's value (so the class's loose_selection_set value
  really applies for the first do_, but it can be
  overridden for undo and redo).
- The Detail_Panel_Base class now does a better job cleaning
  up a closed panel: it actively clears its selection set
  (so that the items can nullify their pointers to the panel),
  it resets Panel_Manager's panel_stack_prev_eap if it points
  to the panel being removed from the ViewStack, and it also
  resets effectively_active_panel if it was that, as well.

Flashclient map editing bugs fixed:
- On new byway, original position of byway contained phantom
  highlight. E.g., just pressing the Ctrl key all alone, regardless
  of where the mouse is, would cause a green highlight to mystically
  appear wherever the new byway had first been laid. This is because
  prepare_item was being called and changed the item's stack
  ID from 0 to a valid client ID, and so the last highlight
  gets left in the highlight set.
- Assert on panel closing when ripe panel found for solo item;
  I fixed the fcn. to handle panels being closed and to salvage
  them if possible (if the selection set is comparable, otherwise
  we use a new panel).
- False loop inconsistency because new byway, when vertex is
  dragged, has same node IDs for both endpoints.
- Fix problem not resuing geofeature panel appropriately when
  old geofeature panel being closed has zero items in it.
- On Vertex move, recycle client stack IDs. This makes debugging
  easier, otherwise the vertex client stack ID keeps changing
  with every on_drag.
- On new intersection, if a T-intersection and a small byway was
  created and then deleted, we were accidentally still selecting
  the deleted byway (so, e.g., the details panel would indicate
  four items selected rather than three, and there'd be a phantom
  vertex on the map).

Change Item_Versioned's "function set selected"
  to "function set_selected" so we can pass additional
  parameters.
  - The fcn. needs to know if, on deselect, an item should
    just be removed from the map or also from the panel
    selection set. And on select, the pan-select tool can
    tell the object if it should use a new panel or try to
    add itself to the current panel (historically, this code
    was confusing, because Geofeature had to infer this info.).
  - I also added a selection_panel reference from Geofeature
    to the panel associated with its map selection. A Geofeature
    can belong to more than one panel's selection set, but there's
    only ever one panel that it belongs to that represents its
    selection on the map.
Fix incorrect pyserver assert when link_values not found for an item
  being heavyweight loaded (i.e., when user selects item on map
  and flashclient lazy-loads the fully hydrated item).

* Mild overhaul of Geofeature's set selected,
  to help figure out correct panel for do/undo/redo
  commands.
  - See also Geofeature.panel_get_for_geofeatures,
    which replaces get_panel_for_single_item.
    The idea is that we want to find a panel for
    one or more geofeatures that are being edited,
    or create a new panel if an existing one cannot
    be found. For existing panels, we may or may not
    care if a panel's selection set exactly matches
    the set of geofeatures being edited, or if the
    selection set can just be a superset of the edited
    set. The latter matters, e.g., when you're dragging
    one vertex of a byway but there are additional byways
    selected. The former matters -- the desired panel should
    have exactly those geofeatures selected -- for, e.g.,
    link_value editing commands (like change attribute, or
    add/remove tag, etc.).
  - I similarly fixed Command_Base.activate_appropriate_panel,
    so it's much smarter about finding or making panels for
    commands.

* Fix Byway_Merge so it activates appropriate panel on do/undo.
* Fix Byway_Merge so it calls items_add with unique Array, since
  items_add removes elements... (also did the same for Byway_Split).
* Fix problem with second details panel appearing for same item type
  (get rid of Command_Base.cmd_item_panel, which no longer works
   well because we can reuse panels now, unless we maintained the
   pointer from the command object to the panel, but it's easier
   to remove the pointer and just use edit_items to find a suitable
   panel for the command).
* Remove item.dpanel (just use Geofeature.get_panel_for_single_item
  or Attachment.attachment_panel)
* Detail_Panel_Base.items_deselect_all now accepts an item as a
  parameter and won't deselect that item. This fixes a problem
  clicking a vertex of a byway and dragging it (since the vertex
  is selected before the panel is cleared, and it seems easier
  to not de-select an item rather than to remember which vertex
  to re-select later; savvy?).
* No need for a command to change panels if all the items in a
  command are already selected (the "aha!" for this bug is that
  there might be additional items also selected, but we don't
  want to disrupt what the user has selected, e.g., consider
  having two byways selected and wanting to drag a vertex of
  one of the byways, and how annoying it would be if we changed
  the active panel selection to just the byway whose vertex is
  being dragged; if I was a user, I'd be annoyed that the other
  byway was needlessly deselected, and that I had to actively
  reselect it ("how dare you waste my precious mouse clicks!")).

* Change assertions to soft assertions in item classes'

* attachment_mode_stop should not always reset the active

  i.e., each panel has a pointer to the last and next panels.
  The pointers are maintained as the user switches panels,
  closes panels, selects items on the map, performs commands,
  uses undo/redo, etc.
* Restrict number of detail panels to one per item type.
* Clicking on the map no longer deselects selected items,
  since that behavior is confusing and possible responses
  to that action are imperfect (e.g., do you close the
  panel, since you've deselected all items, or do you
  switch to the find-route panel? both seem awkward, but
  you can't just empty the details panel, so it makes
  sense to not respond to "mouse clicks on nothing".
* Fix problems removing empty item detail panels
  (they were sometimes being re-activated, albeit with
  an empty selection set).
* Miscellaneous fixes to split byway, make intersection,
  and other commands, but I still have more testing...

Bug 2804: Map Editing and Item Saving: Many Bugs
* Flashclient split byway
  - Split a byway, then join the split segments, then save.
  - pyserver has multiple bugs.
  - flashclient has multiple bugs.
    - on commit response, process "deleted freshies",
      i.e., in the bug example, the two split segments
      are fresh (new) byways that were marked deleted
      when they were joined, so they weren't sent to
      pyserver on commit. But when the commit is complete,
      we have to cleanup these items and delete their
      commands.
    - When splitting, recycle the active panel if it's
      for the byway being split (which is also being
      deleted).
      - This was a bit tricky, so I hope the Geofeature
        set selected function isn't too broken. :/
* Flashclient join byways:
  - In CcpV1, you merged byways into an existing byway,
    and it worked by taking one of the byways being
    joined, merging the others into it one by one,
    and then deleting all the other byways except for
    the one merged into.
    But this is prone to error, and it's not conceptually
    representative of what's happening, i.e., existing
    line segments are all being deleted and being replaced
    by a new line segment (rather than one of the line
    segments being arbitrarily chosed to "grow" into
    the new shape).
    So Byway.merge is replaced by Byway.join_byways
    which takes an array of byways and returns a new
    byway.
    - The new command also merges all of the joinees'
      link_values. The link_values are merged in the
      order that the byways were selected, so if two
      byways have the same link_value but with different
      values, only the byway that was selected earlier
      by the user has its link_value copied to the
      new byway. (See: Detail_Panel_Base.feats_ordered)
* Flashclient Misc:
  - Close detail panel if it no longer has items_selected.
* Pyserver:
  - Item_Manager wasn't loading link_value groups_access
    when asked to load heavyweight byways.
  - Pyserver wasn't handling the deleted split-from from
    the client (it was returning a GWIS error, but the
    client should be okay to send the byway being deleted).
  - The commit command now processes deleted items
    separately.
    - It wasn't making a new version of the item to mark
      deleted!
      - So now we make new versions of the item and all
        of its link_values and then UPDATE all the new
        rows and mark them all deleted.
        - It's tedious, I believe you! We're talking
          group_item_access records for the item and
          all of its link_values, too. So it's a lot
          of recursive code, and it's a lot of work
          to manually inspect the database to make
          sure the code is working well.
Pyserver Miscellaneous:
* From CcpV1, Bug 2803: Make transaction_retryable backoff
  - When retrying a concurrent transaction, pyserver
    now just tries at most three times (not five)
    and sleeps around 1/20th second between tries.
* In finalize_last_version_at_revision, only update records
  with valid_until_rid == conf.rid_inf, since you can change
  group_item_access records without changing an item version,
  i.e., multiple group_item_access records use the same item_id
  but have different valid_until_rids (and UPDATE was failing
  because it was causing a constraint failure).

Lots of editing fixes:
- Connect endpoint to middle of existing block
  and make an intersection
  - I.e., Byway Split, followed by New Intersection
  - The code lazy-loads the block being split because
    it might not have been selected by the user yet,
    and we need its link_values to make the split.
    - BUG nnnn: TEST: Pull the network cable and
      then test the command. I'm wondering how well
      we handle a failed lazy-load...
- Vertex Add works again.
Though not everything is refined:
- After Vertex Add, that tool remains selected, so
  user has to select select/pan tool to move vertex
  (but maybe that's working-as-designed? I think it
  might do this in CcpV1 but I'd think it's backwards).
- BUG nnnn/regression: I think I broke the Create
  Region tool (though Create Byway and Create Point work).
- BUG nnnn/regression: The Split Byway tool acts
  just like the Add Vertex tool and doesn't actually
  split the byways.
  - Which is funny since the Byway Split/New Intersection
    two-in-one-command works.

Fixes to item editing:
- G.map.cm.do_ now lazy-loads items that are not hydrated.
- There are still more editing bugs but I'm making progress...
Miscellaneous:
- Fix get hydrated: it should test invalid instead of fresh.
- Fix get links_lazy_loaded: fresh geofeatures now say true.
- G.map.cm.do_ is now a :void fcn.

Bug 2795: Flashclient: 'make' often fails
- The first time I run 'make', it usually fails, and
    I have to run it once or twice more.
  Sometimes after editing source code files, running
    'make' will fail so many times in a row that I give
    up, kill fcsh, make clean, and try again (where 'so
    many times' is at most six retries before I give up).
  I wondered if maybe this was because each of our source
    code modules import packages rather than specific modules,
  e.g.,

   import utils.misc.*;

  instead of

   import utils.misc.Logging;

  The problem is that a change to any module in a package
    causes any file that imports the package to be recompiled.
    So, e.g., editing utils.misc.Set causes any module that
    imports utils.misc.* to need a recompile.
  And oftentimes, this leads to circular references or
    something just as bad, and 'make' fails.
  Also, editing one file sometimes causes scores of other files
    to be rebuilt. I noticed after fixing this bug that many
    modules, when edited, no longer cause a ton of other modules
    to be recompiled.
  Ug! This took six hours and over 1200 'import ...' statements
  were edited. But compilation is remarkably and rather markedly
  faster!! Hooray!

Big Changes:
- Finally using the latest, greatest and *last* Flex 3
  SDK, 3.6a. Except for a one-line change in fcsh-wrap
  (which checks which SDK we're using and complains if
  it differs from expected), everything seems to work
  peachy.

Auto_install:
- Install 3.6a Flex SDK instead of 3.4a.
- Some scripts now work on Fedora in addition to Ubuntu;
  e.g., gis_compile.sh.
  - Also, bash_base updated to work on Fedora
    - E.g., need to use ifconfig instead of host, and even
    then, sed works differently for me on the two distros.
    I have to escape regex control chars in one distro
    but not for t'other... though I'm sure there's a way
    to fix this: e.g.,
          sed "s/.*inet addr:([.0-9]+).*/\1/"
      vs. sed "s/.*inet addr:\([.0-9]\+\).*/\1/"
- You can install offline/locally by not specifying the 
  host machine and target user, e.g.,
    ./ccp_install.sh - -

Skins file:
- Fix computing key_rank (we need to reset it between each
  set of pen definitions, so key_rank starts appropriately
  at 0 for each distinct pen set).
- Move the "cautionary" bike facilities into their own
  pen set, so we can remove these non-facilities from
  the facility dropdown (and now you can say that a
  road has both a facility and a caution).
- Sort pen keys by rank rather than alphabetically so that
  the GUI client shows options in the same order as they're
  defined by the DEVs in the skin file.

Add "Bicycle Caution" attribute.
- E.g., Difficult Connection, Use Extra Caution,
        and Limited Visibility.

Fix problem centering map on boot with corrupt flash cookies
  (somehow my x,y cookies were corrupted and on boot the map
  wouldn't load properly).
- Rather than just using the x,y cookies, we verify their
  values first and reset them if they're inappropriate.

Fix the zoombar.
- Make the raster level ticks more noticeable (even I can
  barely tell the difference between raster and tile ticks
  in CcpV1, so I added a little green highlight to the raster
  ticks to mean that those zoom levels are interactive; I
  also added a crude toolTip).
- Tweak the map widget glow so that the zoombar and scale
  widget are more readable -- the contrast in CcpV1 is so
  subtle that the zoombar tick marks and the scalebar tend
  to blend into the map. I added a tiny extra glow with a
  little alpha, so there's the original opaque white glow
  and then an extra pixel or two of 0.6 alpha white.

I started to replace package-level imports with just
  module imports.
- This reduces rebuild time, since a package-level import
  means a module is considered dirty and recompiled whenever
  any module in the imported package is changed.
  - E.g., the difference between
           import utils.misc.*;
          and
           import utils.misc.Logging;
    is that, for the former, whenever any file in utils/misc/
    is edited, any module including that package has to recompiled,
    whereas if a module only included the modules it actually
    used, then it's only recompiled when just those modules are
    touched and not whenever any module in the package is touched.
- FIXME: Continue reworking the imports to get rid of .* imports.
  - [lb] thinks this might be causing the problem where 'make'
    always fails the first time and I have to run it a second
    or third time to get all of flashclient to compile (which
    is stupidly tedious and frustrating).

New "alert box"ish components for the new site.
- One system-wide alert sits below the Cyclopath header (search
  bar, Cycloplan logo, et al), and the other alert sits below
  the map toolbar
  - The system-wide alert can show messages from the system, e.g.,
    when we want to take the system offline for maintenance, we
    can send a message to clients first to give users a warning
    that the site is going offline soon (currently, we send a
    Tweet, but really we need to do in-application alerting).
  - The map-wide alert is used to indicate when Cyclopath is in
    read-only node.
  - Both alerts can be dismissed by the user and will fade away
    and disappear.

Implement the Bike Facility Key for the Map Legend.
- Sorry, Stephanie, it was easy to do and we need to get all
  view-mode features complete.

Editing fixes:
- Undo was failing to undo new item create when trying to
  return to a panel that had since been closed.
  - I had to teach undo to differentiate between commands
    that create new items (and thus new panels) and those
    that edit existing items, because for existing items,
    we can always resurrect the item panel if it was closed,
    but when undoing an operation that created a new item
    which created a new panel, it's ambiguous as to which
    panel to show after the undo (since it would be silly
    to show the item panel for an item that doesn't exist).
- Add 'dangle' concept: A byway knows one of its end vertices
  is a dangle if there are no other byways in the adjacency
  lookup.
  - For dangle vertices, we color the square vertex red to
    indicate that it doesn't connect to the network.
- I recently added double-click to vertices to toggle sticky
  connectivity. Now, I change the vertex color depending on
  the setting -- one color to indicate that if the user drags
  the vertex, s/he will break the intersection, and another
  color to indicate that if the user drags the vertex, then
  the whole intersection moves with it.

Little stuff:
- Cleanup the Map Legend panels (common header formatting;
  put content in boxes with one pixel borders).
- Add a little highlight to the map legend key.
- Make the mouse cursor a finger-pointing-hand cursor when
  over the Map Legend button so users know to click it
  to expand/contract the map key (I saw an agency user
  struggle to figure out how to dismiss the map key).
- Add the "controlled access" visualization to the map
  key (e.g., roads with a one pixel red line down the
  center are roads that do not allow bicycle traffic).
- Add a little hint to the bikeability ratings key to
  help people understand the "yours" vs. "ours" distinction.
- To Item Type widget, for Byways, I added two checkboxes
  that will eventually (ahem, FIXME) be implemented and wired
  to the two tags, "Busy" and "Unpaved", since these two
  attributes and very important to planners and cyclists
  (and there's no reason, as a Geowiki, to not enforce at
  least a little standardization of tags, i.e., our users
  already use either "bikelane" or "bike lane" but really
  we should just say, hey, it's called "bikelane" and then
  convert all "bike lane"s to "bikelane".
- Floating tool palette needs to intercept mouse down to
  call stopPropagation so global catcher doesn't clear
  focus.

ha-Ha! This is the *coolest* little nugget since sliced nuggets!

- Double-click a Vertex to toggle Sticky Intersections!

But, Wait, There's More!

- I fixed the Big Annoyance with Irresponsive Dragging.

(Yeah, der, I know, 'irresponsive' isn't a word, but dragging
wasn't unresponsive, it was just stupidly-slow-responsive.)

And a bunch more *semi-cool* nuggetlings of bug fixes
related to messing around with map items.

- There were unnecessary GWIS_Checkout requests happening,
  e.g., after dragging a Vertex and releasing the mouse,
  even though the Viewport had not changed, flashclient
  was sending a checkout request. This was because the
  same fcn. that handles panning the map was also the
  base class fcn. for moving vertices, and it wasn't
  differentiating between the two types of drags.

- I removed the Vertex mouse listeners and implemented
  their mouse handling the same as for Geofeatures. We
  let the map canvas mouse listener handle mouse down,
  mouse move, and mouse up, so that it can also manage
  the double click detector. Making this change -- so
  the Vertex's drag is called deliberately by the map
  canvas mouse handler -- markedly improves user inter-
  action with item vertices.

- Dragging vertices around the map was very unresponsive
  and "jerky". I added a timer to the mouse move handler,
  so that we don't make a new vertex-move command for
  every mouse move. The problem is that, while a user
  is mousing down and dragging a vertex, flashclient
  gets mouse move events every application frame.
  But the vertex-move command is costly --
  as are most undoable/redoable item commands --
  because it creates a new item, checks the new item
  policy, and adds the new item to the map, all of
  which are somewhat time consuming operations.

- Bike Facility tweaks: Replace Extra_Caution_2 with
  Poor_Visibility and also fidget with skin file
  and line definitions to redo a couple of the
  facilities' icons (e.g., poor visibility is now a
  solid green line surrounded with two red, dashed
  gutter lines).

- Awesome new facilities for outstate:
  - Highway High Volume, Highway Low Volume,
    Shoulder High Volume, and Unpaved Rural Road.

- Misc:
  - Renamed R_Tree.draw to R_Tree.draw_tree to help
    us distinguish from the other draw commands, e.g.,
    Geofeature.draw().
  - Fix bug zooming in and out when in edit mode:
    the historic mode fcn. was being called and was
    setting G.app.mode = G.view_mode. Bah.
  - Fixed bug not rebuilding network connectivity.
    The items_add fcn. pops completed items off the
    collection, so we need to array_copy byways so
    we know which ones' networks connections to fix.
  - Moved Route.is_hydrated to base class; renamed
    hydrated; Geofeature is not hydrated until its
    Item_Stack and Link_Values are received, right.
  - Got rid if clone_'s skip_ids and changed init()
    to behave differently -- on init_add, we just
    gml_consume, but on init_update, instead of
    calling clone (which clobbers values the user
    may have edited) we call a new fcn., clone_update,
    which only sets those values that may have been
    lazy loading, e.g., Item_Stack.
  - Fix Attribute.consensus. It cannot just get link
    values for the collection of items but must
    iterate over the items one by one.
  - When you create a new item (e.g., Byway), create
    and open its item details panel.

== DEVS: Database Update: ==

INSERT INTO item_type (id, type_name) VALUES (54, 'link_post');
INSERT INTO item_type (id, type_name) VALUES (55, 'link_attribute');

There's also a new attribute, '/item/reminder_email', you'll need
if you want the item alert widget to work. You could make this in
flashclient and then update value_internal_name='/item/reminder_email'
using psql or ccp.py, but it's probably easier to not care, since
the widget won't crash and you'll get the new attribute the next
time your reload your dev database.

Also, this is a big checkin, so this revision will likely break.
I'm not checking in my complete working folder, but used Meld
(visual diff) to merge most of my changes, so I'll have to
checkout this new revision and fix regression bugs...

== The bugs: ==

There were a lot of bugs in discussions and with the new
item attachment widget.
- I fixed a few bugs saving and checking out posts,
  and linking geofeatures to posts.
  - Also, annoying regression: when you attach places
    to a post, the post button gets pushed underneath
    the side panel but the vertical scroll bar doesn't
    change, so you can't post your places!
  - Unfortunately, this took a little time to figure
    out -- we have to override the Flex Data_Grid and
    then figure out and hack the height at the
    appropriate time.
- Multiple bugs because of leftover static variables
  from CcpV1 -- [mm] updated Discussions with the new
  selection widget (which is very cool), but neither
  of us tested discussions very well. I found a number
  of problems, mostly related to Item_Manager's
  active_thread and active_post, and also Post's
  first and reply. The active_thread and active_post
  are silly, because we can get that info from
  effectively_active_panel, and also because the values
  were not maintained well and could get out of sync
  (so that, e.g., you could save a post to the wrong
  thread). As for Post.first and Post.reply, don't get
  me started. These are pulvarized. Using application-
  level static class objects for an item panel's item
  reference? Yikes. Now the panels and the items in
  question figure this out without using a scary shared
  static.
  - Got rid of weird Post.reset() fcn.
- Threads and Post and Link_Posts are now added to the
  item lookups, e.g., Attachment.all, by way of
  G.map.items_add.

Lots of Great Fixes a Long Time Coming:
- Byway Rating
  - I made this an immediate command -- in CcpV1, ratings
    were part of the undo/redoable command stack and had
    to be saved with the rest of the map. Now, changing
    the widget value in flashclient causes an immediate
    GWIS command.
  - I fixed issues on pyserver -- I had implemented the
    CcpV2 code for ratings earlier in commit, but it was
    not fully tested. At this point, I think ratings is
    all done: on commit, if a byway is edited, or if a
    byway's tags or attribute link_values are edited, or
    if a byway is rated, the system recalculates the
    generic rating. After the commit, the command hups
    the route finder, and routed always checks for new
    ratings when it's hupped.
- Item Watching (Item Alerts)
  - This is a very simple but very elegant custom control.
    - It's like the one-way control, which is a label
      showing the current setting and then a small
      button for cycling through the different settings.
  - Because the user cannot see all of the watching options
    at one time (they have to click the 'Change' button to
    cycle through them all), there's a delay of some number
    of seconds between the time the setting is changed and
    when flashclient sends the GWIS command.
    - But not that we also send the command early if the
      side panel changes, or if the user saves the map.
- NOTE: Watching is still not completely implemented;
        the email cron job script is the last piece of
        the puzzle.... I rewrote it to CcpV2 a while
        ago, but item watchers are now private link
        values, so it needs to be updated again.
- Deeplink generation.
  - See the new network cmd, GWIS_Stealth_Create.
  - In CcpV1, when a user "shares" a route (adds it
    to their library; see the command, ShareRoute),
    pyserver generates a deeplink for the route. In CcpV2,
    users can generate deeplinks to any publicly editable
    item, and also to any item they can arbit.
    - So in CcpV2, the stealth secret a) is not generated
    automatically, and b) can be created on any item type,
    not just routes.

- Fix Item Delete in flashclient.
  - The Map Mode implementation was throwing an assert that
    led me to find out that removing an item from the map
    when deleted was also wrongly removing the item from
    the deletedset.
  - The UI interaction is still unrefined, but the
    operation seems to work (e.g., when you delete an item
    from the map, we still don't cleanup its panel, but at
    least the item is removed from the panel, so the panel
    shows, "nothing selected").

Cleaned up Item_Manager.
- Move G.map.dirtyset to G.item_mgr.dirtyset so it's
  with its companion collection, G.item_mgr.deletedset.
- Got rid of kludgy variables like 'active_post' and
  either moved them to the panel classes or recoded
  their usage -- a lot of uses was from widgets who
  were descendents of the details panel in question,
  so they can just, e.g., call this.parentDocument.

Add caller payload to GWIS_Base (caller_data).
- I'm suprised we haven't found a need for this before.

Add restrict_dirty to GWIS_Commit.
- So we can commit just a subset of what's dirty, i.e.,
  for saving ratings or for saving watchers independently
  of saving dirty map items.

Random fixes to undo/redo and item saving.
- I'm still debugging undo/redo/save... next time! =)

Flashclient:
- On item details panel, instead of not showing anything in
the name header when multiple items with different names
are selected, show, "Various Names" in italics.
- Fix Attribute.consensus with _two_ defaults: one for
when multiple items share the attribute but not the same
value, and another for when no items are selected.
- Fix Attribute panel name widget, which was not having
its width set, so the label was hidden.
- For view mode, show bike facility as an uneditable
label, of sorts (it's a Canvas we just paint on, but
we show that instead of the combo box).
- Hide the tag widget 'X' button in view mode.
- Hide the 'Show Road type'/'Hide Road type' widget
because we have view and edit mode now.
- Restore the inline hints for the attribute list
on the item details panel.
- There was a crash (bad assert) when making a new
route feedback post.
- For whatever reason, Route_Stop_Entry was referencing
this.parent_proxy.parent instead of just this.parentDocument,
and it finally failed on a null reference. I think I changed
a this.parent.parent from CcpV1 to this.parent_proxy.parent
to side-step a Flex warning, but the real issue was not just
using this.parentDocument to boot! =)_
- Fix the hard reference in List_Disableable to a worldly
view component. That class is a utility class, but it was
created before I knew better about how item renderers could
get at their parents... and in this case, List_Disableable
had to get at its parent, Combo_Box_V2 (which isn't always
the parent) to get at the combo's parent, Floating_Tool_Palette
(and obviously the latterest is never always the parent of
Combo_Box_V2, so you can see why the hard-coded hack was
tolerated for so long).
- Fix New_Item_Policy's matches_target to work on dummy
Link_Value when testing user's permissions (since a dummy
Link_Value won't have its attc or feat members set).
- New Combo_Box_V2 option to show special button, i.e.,
something other than what's in the dropdown is used as the
combo button. We use this for the "Varies" situation.
- Rename some buttons, like Save Changes and Discard Changes
to Save Map and Start Over, so that that save button can be
distinguished from other save buttons. Also, Start Over is
more meaningful, maybe -- what does Discard mean, I mean, I
don't see a trash can anywhere.
 - Start Over implies that the user can do things that don't
 matter, so hopefully users will be less intimidated by our
 map. "Oops, I just edited, but nevermind, I can "Start Over"!"
- Disable Route Feedback Ask Me Later widget: it lets anyone
enter any email address to be emailed... but seems like a big
gaping security hole. We should use the logged in user's
registered account email -- which probably means we don't
let anonymous users ask to be asked later (though we could
give them a deeplink to the route for them to keep for later).

db_glue was logging an error on an _anticipated_ integrity
error, which was causing a script to get flagged as
failing. now it logs a debug trace instead. (see:
integrity_errs_okay).

Regression (well, missed code from an earlier merge):
- Was missing override fcn:
   Panel_Item_Thread.attachment_highlights_update
  Sorry, Mikhil! I guess no one's used the thread
  panel recently, though...

In flashclient,

New Bikeability_Rating.as class
- Finally: a Class for all the hard-coded ratings values! =)

To Combo_Box_V2, ability to show custom button when "Varies"
- I.e., when you select multiple items on the map and they
don't share the same values, we can draw a special button
on the combo box to indicate as such. Note that this special
button does _not_ appear as an option in the dropdown list.
- Instead of XML, using Objects now for dataProvider, which
are robustier.

Fix for editing Link_Value values: also be sure to update
the attached geofeature's attrs or tags collection, which
is supposed to be a lightweight mirror of the actual link
value values.

Don't forget to clear Dirty_Reason.item_schg in
update_item_committed.

Improvements to Byway.draw_bike_facil.

Regression: assertion when changing byway rating, because
new map mode was asserting that there is one or more
revisiony changes -- but a byway rating is not that type
of dirty.

Fix UI_Wrapper_Attr_Link to work with ComboBox.
- It used to just work with Steppers.
- This wires, e.g., the Bike_Facility widget to undo/redo
and other command stack features.

Lots of little tweaks to the item details panel widgets,
both visual and functional.
- Finish wiring the Bike Facility widget:
  - Undo/redo now works.
  - Using the Combobox is immediately reflected on the map.
- Bug nnnn: There's still a bug where zooming causes a
checkout, and the checked out item is being clone()d onto
the editing item (wiping its Geofeature.attrs, so the Bike
Facility value is getting clobbered, at least in the lightweight
lookup).

Big Bug nnnn: apache_event table script on production
server (itamae) has been broken since last fall, so now
the upgrade script copies all of the archived apache logs
from itamae and repopulates the entire apache_event table.
- Lots of fixes to apache2sql.py, including logging warnings
rather than silently failing when input cannot be parsed.
- Also, apache2sql.py is now a Cyclopath script_base class.
- This fixes problems with the statistics graphs the nightly
script makes for the Wiki project page.

New Bash fcns. in ccp_base.sh:
- Get Cyclopath installation latest revision ID and timestamp.

Apache Tilecache cron job:
- Keep a touch file of the latest revision timestamp for each
branch, so it can quickly not do anything (the script runs
every minute, so it should figure out as painlessly as
possible if there's work to do and exit quickly if there is
none).
- In addition to the touch file, the script now doesn't do
anything on --changed if it sees that a branch's revision
ID hasn't changed since the last time the script ran.
- Change tilecache_update.py's option to make more sense:
  Replaced --skip-cache-table-remake w/ opposite, --cyclopath-cache
  Replaced --skip-cache-seed-remake w/ opposite, --tilecache-tiles

Fix issues with revision.Updated (just used by routed's tgraph
and tilecache_update, so not tested much recently, but now pyserver
code makes a temp table of stack IDs of geofeatures that changed
and of geofeatures with link_values that changed, and that temp
table is joined against when fetching geofeatures (it's a two-step
process when you use revision.Updated)).

Geofeature skins:
- To Attr_Pen, let skin set key_rank, so we can support hidden
options, e.g., Bicycle Facility sets a hidden option at
key_rank=-2 that's used when there are multiple items selected
and their values do not match (so the combo box shows the hidden
option on the button, but the hidden option does not appear in
the dropdown).
- Fiddle with skin_bikeways.py: regarding gap widths and gutter
widths: if a byway is drawn at an angle, e.g., downtown
Minneapolis, some ornamentation shows weird artifacts. Using
fatter line widths and gap widths hides the artifacts.
- Also use a white background now for the bike facilities,
so we don't just let whatever funky color beneath it bleed
through.

Flashclient:
- Add Conflation_Job class because it's in the new
  item policy now ([ft] is implementing Conflation in
  the mobile/ svn branch, so this is just a placeholder).
- Cleanup build_id script: we might as well just add our
  own MXML and use the static BUILD_INFO class variables
  rather than hiding the UI elements in the Perl script.
- Fix layout and wording of the route-using-bike-facils
  option.
- Add route-using-approved-bikeways to basemap branch
  (using the new, non-approved /byway/cycle_facil attr).
  - Also add same to flash cookies and save with other
    user route preferences.
  - Also rename from 'metc_bikeways' to 'use_bike_facils'
    because the former doesn't quite capture the meaning.
- Decouple tile server from Cyclopath installation server,
  so developers can use the server's tiles.
- Add Terrain to some Geofeature class lists.
  - I.e., to Attachment.as, so Terrain can have attachments.
- Fix Geofeature.has_tag so that it checks the lightweight
  this.tags lookup.
- For the map legend, we have to manage a sometimes-there
  horizontal scrollbar.
  - Added complements to has_VerticalScrollBar and vsb_width:
    has_HorizontalScrollBar.
  - Made static fcn. wrappers for 'em so code can be reused.
- Add toolTip to Help_Link widget.
- Removed selective_attrs, which was a silly construct:
  - The idea was to lazy load important attributes after
    the viewport loaded all the geofeatures, but now
    pyserver includes the lightweight attrs collection
    on viewport checkout, so selective_attrs is redundant
    (and more cumbersome).
  - Oh, and -- haha -- it was never implemented correctly:
    it didn't specify a callback, and it didn't have an
    update request attached to it, so the response from
    pyserver was never processed! Though [lb] wonders why
    a particular assert never fired (the one that says
    there should be a callback or an update request, or maybe
    both, but never neither!) so my understanding of the
    problem is incomplete but it's solved so who cares.

- Major fix to boot load time, especially at fullscreen,
  which would time out for me (if I booted flashclient in
  a small browser window and then went fullscreen, it was
  okay, but if I booted at fullscreen, the flash plugin
  would time out and stop running flashclient).
  - The problem was the route library code from CcpV1
    causes the nodes_rebuild function to be called for
    every route in the library, which is a very expensive
    operation -- and grows exponentially (probably) as the
    size of the viewport grows!
  - And nodes_rebuild was being called redundantly: for
    every route in the library, it was recalculating all
    of the intersections for all of the byways on the map.
  - There might still be the case the Intersection_Detector
    and Node_Snapper are both calling nodes_rebuild when it
    should only be called once but it's late and I want to
    check in code... the situation is much improved, but
    probable not perfect (like lots of things in CcpV2!).

Flashclient Regressions:
- "Restricted" tag ornament was not being drawn on byways
  (was checking just the heaveyweight link_value tags and
  not the lightweight tags Set).
- Major fix to canvas clipping and height/width:
  - The 'map' component was wrapped in a new Canvas,
    map_canvas_print, when the print-to-pdf feature
    was implemented, but the map component sizes
    itself using its this.parent, but now map_canvas_print
    is its parent, and the width/height of map_canvas_print
    are not the same as those of map_canvas. I.e., we want
    G.app.map_canvas.width/height.
- Don't draw caps for byway shadow lines, otherwise roads
  with higher z-levels don't blend well w/ lower z-level
  roads.
- On new route panel, when you click "Show More Options",
  move the scrollbar so the new content shows, otherwise
  it looks like nothing happens.
  - Also, unique toolTips for each individual slider value.
- I flipped the order of the bikeability slider on the
  find new route panel:
  1. The 'Prefer roadways with bike facilities' widget
     (new to the basemap, but old on the metc branch)
     is left-aligned below the left-hand side of the
     slider, and it's a bikeability enhancer, so it
     feels unnatural being below the 'Fast' option and
     not the 'Friendly' one.
  2. What's more natural in human nature? Don't people
     tend to associate the left as being more friendly
     than the right? Well, at least here's an article
     that says "Face's Left Side More Attractive Than Its
     Right Side, Study Shows"
       http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/21/
        face-left-side-more-attractive_n_1443325.html

Flashclient Map Legend:
- Fixed a big problem with automatically sizing.
  - Pixel pushing... ug. If the app window is tight,
    we show one or both scrollbars and add a pixel
    of padding so they aren't clipped. If the app
    window is super loose, we restrain the legend
    from growing too large (or even overlaying the
    zoombar if the window is large enough to
    comfortably sit both).
  - Making great use of the ChangeWatcher object
    I recently leared about -- rather than watching
    for resize events (which fire duing a resize,
    perhaps), watch for the width and height attributes
    of a component to change).

Apache cron job:
- Script was being chatty (echo without $DTRACE &&).

CcpV1->V2 upgrade scripts:
- Bikeways import failing because code was handling
  ogr.OFTReal and ogr.String but forgetting about
  ogr.OFTInteger.
- make_new_branch script shouldn't fail if MetC
  username is not found in user_ table.

Route finder:
- Make use-bike-facilities option work on public basemap.
- Make use-bike-facilities option check what _type_ of
  facility is indicated so it can exclude negative facilites
  (e.g., Use Caution, Difficult Connection, etc.).

To tile cache update script:
- Release script and branch async locks when finished.

To apache cron script:
- Fix tars so whole directory ancestry is not included
  (i.e., 'cd' to the directory and tar from there).

New script to make the macros_*.m4 files.
- I added a new macro, m4_PPUSH, for trace statements
  that just report measurements of UI components
  (PPUSH stands for pixel pushing, i.e., when you're
  trying to nudge a component perfectly into place).
- See also Conf_Instance.debug_loggers_enabled, which
  is a Set() of enabled speciality trace macros (i.e.,
  not the normal m4_DEBUG, m4_INFO, m4_WARNING, etc.,
  macros).

New Conf_Instance.wms_url_base so developers can
use the tiles on the server and don't have to load
them locally.

A few fixes to apache_check_cache_now and
tilecache_update.py for the crontab job.
- Tilecache_update was not releasing the
  locks it claimed (the ones recorded
  in the database table, async_locks).
- The check_cache_now script was being
  overly verbose (emailing when it
  didn't have any work to do).
- The check_cache_now script now checks
  the dump it's about to write to make
  sure that, if it exists, it's writeable
  by the apache user.

These are all flashclient changes:

Revamp Map_Key:
- moved to flashclient/views/map_legend
- split into multiple classes
- split the map key into multiple smaller
  views
- you can navigate the map keys and other
  map-related views using a small side
  panel menu
- i moved and organized most of the
  branch details panel widgets here,
  in the map key -- the branch list
  (changing maps), accessing the
  attributes list (editing and adding
  new attributes), the software version
  and link to privacy, etc.

Has flashclient been missing overrides
of the deleted fcn?
- Now we remove items from the class
  lookups -- there's a fcn. to get
  deleted items, but flashclient hasn't
  been good about moving deleted items
  off of the active lists.
- This'll probably cause problems down
  the road, but this change seems
  necessary -- we have the items_deleted
  list, and we weren't using it right.

Fix problem seen hidden object's toolTip
on boot.

Lots of work to the Attribute details panel.

Fix problem with item details panel mouse
listener stealing focus -- now it only steals
focus when it knows it was clicked on and not
another control, which is how it is intended
to work (i.e., so that users can get rid of
the annoying blinking cursor (my Vim editor's
cursor doesn't even blink! -- though maybe
there's a flex way to turn this off, but that
might confuse some users...) -- anyway, some
users might want to look at the map and not
be distracted, or they might want to feel
like a change they made to an edit control
actually sticks, like, "type-type-type, click",
meaning my edit was a success!).

Fix Hyper_Link so its colors are more easily
configured.

Fix problem with map canvas background coming
to foreground on boot and covering half the
side panel. Yes, [lb] is annoyed easily.

Update apache_check_cache_now.sh to run asynchronously with
upgrade_ccpv1-v2.sh and publish_ccpv1-v2.sh.
- In Ccpdev repository, I renamed daily.huffy.v1-v2-update.sh
  to upgrade_ccpv1-v2.sh
  - This affects a lot of server scripts but I'm always
    manually mucking around with it and its lock dirs, and
    assigning a unique name makes tab completion work a lot
    better in bash. Also, this script isn't huffy-specific.
    Oh, and it's no longer a daily cron job -- it's meant
    to be run every minute in volley with the check_cache_now
    and publish_ccpv1-v2 scripts.
- V1->V2 scripts can run continuously now:
  - One script is always running the schema upgrade and
    scripts/setup/ruinc/* scripts.
  - Another script is always running the www-data
    check_cache_now script, which makes the tilecache
    cache database cache and mapserver tiles.
  - A final script to make database dumps after the two
    other scripts have run and to package the tiles for
    developers to download to their offline machines.
- The scripts using directory locks and check timestamps
  to coordinate their efforts and to only do work when
  work is ready.

Add some logcheck warnings to a text file in the throwaway
doc/landonb folder... hopefully these'll go away when we update
to the new CcpV2 server.

Typo in conflation.py from the last time I merged (my mistake!).

Lots of updates to service code (routed, mr_do, etc.).

Great new bash fcn., flock_dir, to handle using directories
as inter-process locking mechanisms.

Also a much more boring bash fcn., dir_resolve, to resolve
a relative file path to an absolute file path.

Bugfixes to tilecache_update to newish code that sets bike_facility
from last week's new /byway/cycle_facil attribute.

Fix to attachment highlights code:
- The new attachment_highlights_update fcn. broke opening
  the attribute panel, because the if/else block was
  asserting if not a thread or annotation panel.
  - I decoupled the if/else code, i.e., instead of calling
      if (item is type) ... else if (item is type)...
    we just call
      item.fcn()
    and use polymorphism to determine what to do (so the
    code was moved from UI.as to Panel_Item_Thread and
    Panel_Item_Annotation, and a base fcn. was added to
    Panel_Item_Versioned).

The recent track conflation upgrade script broke the
V1->V2 upgrade:
- The schema upgrade script specified @once-per-instance
  but was inserting into item_type, which is in the public
  schema, so the statement was failing the second time
  the script was run (e.g., it works the first time on,
  say, minnesota, and then fails the second time, on colorado).

Fix bug logging on if token expired: flashclient gets
stuck in a loop and continually asks for your password
over and over again.
- The problem was code that copied CcpV1's behavior
  and reused GWIS commands. Now we just scrap everything
  and start the Update over, firing off fresh GWIS
  commands.

Server now sends coverage_area to client so that the
branch details panel's "locate" feature works (the
map will pan and zoom to include, well, the whole
map).

Fix problem in Dual_Rect.valid: In addition to
checking !isNaN, we also have to check isFinite.

Some fixes/cleanup to the attribute panel.

CHANGES:
  
CcpV1->V2 SQL update script changes:
- Add column: attribute.spf_field_name
  (Shapefile field name).
  - So users have more control over import/export
    (so anyone can change the Shapefile field name
    used for each attribute using flashclient (or
    ccp.py, or GWIS) and we don't need to have an
    engineer edit any branches/*_defs.py source
    code files.
- Change track.x and track.y from INTEGERs
  to REALs (for [ft]'s track conflation).
- Copy-pasted code to convert private
  track.comments to CcpV2-style annotations
  (link_value, group_item_access, and all).

New array_in fcn. for bash.

Update auto_install scripts:
- New software: OAuth, Networkx, NumPy,
  QSopt, Concorde TSP, SciPy.

New /byway/cycle_facil attribute.
- Complements /metc/bike_facil.
- Populated by new script, bike_facilities_populate.py.

New new_item_policy for track conflation:
- Allow all users to start new conflation jobs
  (work_items).

Missed some changes from check_cache_now-wrap.sh
to check_cache_now.sh in earlier checkins.

Flashclient fixes...
- Problem not initing Geofeature's tags and attrs.
- Use Map Key button to show active branch name.
  - I'm not sure this is the right spot for it,
    but it's a start (we need to show the branch
    name somewhere that's always visible... and
    "Map Key" is useless text, or at least it was
    occupying precious text space).
- Fix bike facility items when not showing all rows
  in the dropdown (Flex reuses icon objects as the
  user scrolls the dropdown, so when the item gets a
  data change event, it needs to redraw itself).
- I finally learned about the parentDocument pointer,
  which lets us get from a dropdown item to the parent
  ComboBox (i.e., so our custom bike facility widget
  item renderers can get at our custom bike facility
  combo_box_v2 widget).
  - We can also auto-size the dropdown now, as the
    item renderer measures itself (using TextLineMetrics)
    to figure out its dimensions.
- Catch mouse in route reaction so detail panel base
  doesn't lose focus.
- Lots of fixes to the bike_facility widget.

Big Change: Skins are now wired to flashclient.
- Rather than send them via GWIS, I wrote a Python
  script to auto-generate ActionScript classes so
  we can just import the skins like normal, easy-to-
  use classes. (I suppose GWIS could just send a big
  XML lookup that we could access directly, but hard-
  coding means we can access to the skin values on
  boot and don't have to wait for the server to start
  drawing.) See: flashclient_classes.py.
- Implemented Conf.tile_skin to replace draw class stuff,
  like Conf.draw_param and Conf.geofeature_layer_by_id.

Fix Nonwiki_Item classes to accept rev in constructor
so flashclient's bless_new works (otherwise, when the
item is being destroyed, some asserts complain that
the rev is null).

Awesome new Bicycle Facility widget!
- I swiped color and ornaments from the City of Portland:
    "Portland by Bicycle" Citywide Bike Map, by the City of Portland.
    http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/391729
- It's a Combo_Box_V2 but with a custom item renderer that
  uses the same Paint.draw_line as Byway to paint the road
  to a Canvas -- meaning, the menu is drawn according to the
  active skin.

Don't show Geofeature vertices unless in edit mode.
- Only show the thin blue line.
- I'm not 100% convinced this is right, but it's at
  least better than having all vertices visible and
  active in view mode. We can work backwards from here.

Fix Byway.draw and Paint.line_draw to handle the ornaments
for the new Bicycle Facility widget, including a skate-border
(two thin lines outside the main line, separated by emptiness)
and better support for dashed lines.
- Also added new Byway.draw_bike_facil so the Bike Facility
  widget can draw its dropdown options using the same fcn.
  that the geofeatures use.

Changed some os.mkdir to os.mkdir(..., 02775).

Some more minor Map_Key cleanup, mostly pixel pushing.

Merge from Mikhil, r29992 through r30133
  br/masli_statewide-ui-discussions_2784
(well, more like r30049 through r30133).

I [lb] made a few changes to [mm]'s branch:
* Changed the Editing Button and edit mode behavior:
  - I restored the animation of the tool palette dissolving
    in and out of focus.
  - I fixed a problem with turning on the off the tool palette
    visibility -- it was jumping all around because play_effect()
    was being called incorrectly. I fixed the code to instead use
    map_editing_enabled and restored the animation code that
    makes the tool palette visible.
  - I made the button a ToggleButtonBar button so it doesn't
    flicker as badly when clicked.
  - I added dummy calls to on_mode_change so that widgets still
    setup if they're created late and miss the first mode change.
  - I moved the Print Map and Save PDF buttons to make more room
    in the map header. It's nice and sparse now, just the aerial/road
    toggle, the editing toggle, and a dropdown of less-used but still
    frequently used items.

Fix some focus issues in the panel.
- E.g., in the sharing panel, after clicking on the weblink,
  it was losing focus because the panel's click listener
  was clearing focus.

Fix problem with route destinations not showing up.
- The first child of a DataGrid item renderer is the
  only child that gets rendered, so be sure to put all
  of your controls within a containing HBox or VBox.

Fix deep-links, both CcpV1-style and new CcpV2 style.
- The new style can find items of any type - i.e., no
  longer just routes.
- Here's an example of the new style. Note that you
  don't need to specify the item type (it's optional,
  but helpful to give a human user the context of the
  link). Note also that you can use the item stack ID
  or its stealth secret.

   http://ccpv3/#get?type=route&link=1584955
- Fixed the sharing widget's deeplink widget, which
  previously was just showing some hard-coded test text.
- Flashclient Query_Filters was missing use_stealth_secret.

Fix the sharing widget's action dropdown.
- It was firing the 0th-place event every time repopulate
  was called on the panel, because the change event is
  always called when the dataProvider changes. So now the
  callback checks that the dropdown's open() event has
  recently fired and not the corresponding close() event yet.
- Don't show the create-deeplink action if the deep link
  already exists, or if the user cannot at least edit the
  item.

Fix the secondary name widget on the route panel.
- The maxWidth needed to be set on the name widget...
- I'm still not sure we need the same editable name control
  in the panel header area and also in the route details
  tab panel... but it looks nice above the route length
  (otherwise the route length label looks really lonely...).

Fix problem checking out route.
- Pyserver was not using DISTINCT ON and was returning
  multiple identical route_steps.

Replaced a nasty tight loop in Route_Editor_UI with a
proper wait-for-event-callback-rather-than-spinning-
endlessly-you-silly-gimboid.

New ccp.py option, --wide-log, to ignore terminal width when
setting pyserver logging line width (useful for running ccp.py
from cron, where there is no terminal, per se, and output is
just being logged to a file).

Recent permissions changes have been causing failures in some
of the scripts that update uses (i.e., these aren't scripts
writ just for the update but general purpose scripts that
happen to be used by the V1->V2 update, and running the update
tickled these failures).
- They were mostly in item_user_access.prepare_and_save_item.
  The scripts, link_attributes_populate, make_new_branch, etc.,
  had been creating items with an explicit, unchecked collection
  of groups_accesses (GIA records). I enhanced the code to
  check access_style_id and then to vet the groups_accesses
  records the caller sends. So calling prepare_and_save_item is
  no longer a hack but now a valid alternative to commit
  when one wants to make new items (historically, i.e., in 
  CcpV1, you either created new items directly by crafting
  an SQL "INSERT", or you created them in flashclient and
  transmitted them to the server (put_feature/commit);
  in CcpV2, you can also use pyserver item class code to
  create items, but until now this was a little hacky
  because you could just use a collection of GIA records
  and they were blindly accepted. But now we check the
  access_style_id of the item and the GIA records and
  everything's golden and secure.
- New Item Policy was not checking item.real_item_type_id,
  which is used when we partially hydrate an item, e.g.,
  we want a byway's permissions so we just checkout an
  item_user_access object but not a real byway object. Our
  code was using isinstance, but that doesn't work, since
  we have an intermediate type that's masquerading as a
  leafy item; so we use the item class's child_item_types,
  which I thankfully created recently to handle just
  this case, where we want to know what leafy items an
  intermediate item _might_/_could_ be.

pyserver was not saving session_id to group_item_access for
new, anonymously requested routes (or, more accurately,
for new items with 'restricted'-style access created by
anonymous_username). So now when an anonymous user requests
a group, one GIA record is saved -- for the session ID
group along with the user's session ID.

Add constraint to group_membership table to prevent duplicates
(same group_id and user_id but different stack_ids).

Undo-ing and redo-ing still doesn't work correctly. Tested saving new and
deleting existing place-annotation link-values. These work, but both result in
flashclient errors after the commit succeeds. Here are some notes on these
exceptions:

Deletion:

   In Item_Manager::update_items_committed(), there is a loop that iterates
   through all the items that have just been saved and has the command manager
   clear them. However, this loop ignores items that have been deleted.

   What if the item was deleted? In that case, it was item_discard()-ed before
   the commit was called. Hence, it won't be found in the .all[] lookups, and
   hence won't be processed above.

Addition:

   1. When a new link_value is created, Item_User_Access::init_permissions()
      is called, which in turn calls
      Item_User_Access::group_access_add_or_update().
         
   2. Item_User_Access::group_access_add_or_update() doesn't find the
      specified group_id in this.group_accesses and hence, creates a new one
      called grpa.

   3. It calls grpa.dirtyset_add(Dirty_Reason.item_grac).

   4. Group_Item_Access::dirtyset_add() adds itself to the parent item's (i.e.
      the link_value's) dirtyset_gia but doesn't add itself to the collection
      of objects to be sent to the server. This seems inconsistent. Either
      both should happen or neither. So, what's the right behaviour?

Wrapper for check_cache_now.sh so we don't have to stick a
bunch of environment variables in www-data's crontab (since
cron doesn't support line continuation, it's best to just
call a script from cron and not setup any paths).

Cool Feature: Remote Routed Debugging!
- Added a routed-host and routed-port param
  so you can force route_get.py to talk to
  another server's route daemon instead of
  one of its own.

Lots of scripts fixes:
- to V1->V2 scripts.
- to runic daily cron job scripts (and to lots of the
  scripts that itamae's cron job calls on the CcpV1
  production server that have been broken for, well,
  since the birth of CcpV2).
- to check_cache_now and kill_check_cache.
  - I wrote a bash fcn. to iterate over a faked
    multidimensional array and call a callback
    on each sub-array of parameters. This makes
    it easier to define the set of installation
    folders, database instances, and instance
    branches for each of the cyclopath server
    machines.
  - A new wrapper script template. It specifies
    the details of the installed Cyclopath servers
    so the check_cache_now script knows what to do.

Oops, my earlier calculation of 3000001 for the CcpV2
starting stack ID is wrong -- that was based on a post
v1-v2 update database. We now start at stack ID 1654321.

To svn propget svn:ignore: I addded .vimprojects-bak and log.txt.

Flashclient:
- Fix route finder to send route request if user presses
  Enter when focus is in the 'to' or 'from' text control.

Some comments changes and changes all over the place
because I wanted to remove all differences between my
working copy and the trunk. Next I will merge Mikhil's
and Stephanie's branches against a clean working copy.
Which feels nice.

Fix saving groupy items in pyserver: need to select
a default for item_stack.access_style_id.
- The item_stack class will also look up this value
  when saving an existing item, if it's not set.

Lots of little fixes to CcpV2 upgrade scripts.
- make_new_branch.py needs to set branch's
  access_level_id to 'permissive'.
  - also wasn't clearing existing new_item_policy
    records when updating an existing branch.

V1-V2 fixes (ug... not more of these!)
- fixes to dupl. key conflicts trying to populate
  item_stack table from existing tables (this is
  new code from last week that hadn't been tested
  during update until now).
- a few places where new item_stack rows weren't
  being populated with access_style_id and/or
  access_infer_id.
- use inline pgsql fcns. to remove inline fcns.
  from where clauses to improve performance.
- Restarting the stack ID sequence at 3000001
  (item_stack_stack_id_seq) so tiles and Cycloplan
  shapefile can use a more static branch ID (otherwise
  I have to rebuild tiles and change the stack ID in
  the shapefile every time I run these dern scripts!;).

New kill_cache_chech.sh script to complement
check_cache_now. It sudo-kills cache checker and
its background child processes.

tilecache_update:
- The skip_cache_table_remake option wasn't
  totally implemented: the check_cache_now
  script showed that it was still going after
  the branch lock, which it doesn't need
  (otherwise we can't run scripts in
  parallel).

check_cache_new: Totally Multi-Threaded!! The script
updates all servers' branches' caches simultaneously, and
then it updates groups of all servers' branches' zoom
levels simultaneously. I've tested one server with two
branches and three zoom level groups and saw six cores in use!

DEVS: These are instructions for the changes I made over
the weekend to allow multiple installations of Cyclopath
to happily coexist.

Each Cyclopath installation now has its own sub-directory
in the tilecache-cache folder

You'll need to make the following changes.

1. Edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*.

Change three paths to include the Cyclopath installation
folder name (e.g., your souce code folder in /ccp/dev).

E.g., if my installation is installed to
/ccp/dev/cycloplan_prod, I have this line in my apache conf:

  DocumentRoot /export/scratch/ccp/dev/cycloplan_prod/htdocs

I need to copy the folder name -- cycloplan_prod -- to
PythonInterpreter, MS_MAPFILE, and TileCacheConfig.

And please also note: wms_instance.map is also different,
and so is the path to tilecache.cfg.

  PythonInterpreter minnesota___cycloplan_prod
  ...
  SetEnv MS_MAPFILE /export/scratch/ccp/var/tilecache-cache/cycloplan_prod/wms_instance.map
  ...
  PythonOption TileCacheConfig /export/scratch/ccp/var/tilecache-cache/cycloplan_prod/tilecache.cfg

2. Chmod the daily log location.

When www-data runs check_cache_now.sh and tilecache_update.py,
it'll try to write to the daily log location:

  chmod 2777 /ccp/var/log/daily

3. Update pyserver/CONFIG.

Edit tilecache_cache_dir:

  tilecache_cache_dir: /ccp/var/tilecache-cache/cycloplan_prod

Now is also a good time to make sure server_ip is set. If it's
not set, ./ccp.py -U yourname --no-password will not work.

To get your machine's IP address,

  host -t a ${HOSTNAME} | awk '{print $4}' | egrep ^[1-9]

And then update server_ip. E.g.,

  server_ip: 128.101.34.16

Fixes for finding new route. Which now works again...
some pyserver stuff was confused because qb.username
is sometimes none for new routes (for node_endpoints,
for one) and flashclient was also confused about handling
a new route (replacing the existing dummy route, switching
to the new panel...).

New attr for clone_(), skip_ids, so callers can choose to
use clone for updating an existing item (via init_update)
or actually creating new items and start with blank IDs
(i.e., delete private item and make public copy, or make a
private copy of a public item). This was done because a
new route was tickling an assert in item_versioned.clone.

or reload the CcpV2 data from from

  /scratch/huffy/ccp/var/dbdumps/ccpv3-pluto.dump

Changes:

- Reimplemented style_change, used by Gwis to indicate permissions
  changes, and replaced access_scope with access_infer, which does
  the same as both but more -- it indicates an item's general GIA
  records so we can better calculate access scope in the database.
  This is useful when, e.g., a client asks for a list of routes for
  the route library and the server's response includes an indication
  of whether each route is private, shared, public, etc.
  
- In flashclient, when an item is received via GWIS and we already
  have that item, we call item.init(), which calls init_update().
  init_update now calls clone, instead of implementing all that
  code itself.
  
- Fixed some bugs in init_cleanup() when you change branches.

r29997 | landonb | 2013-04-18 14:24:40 -0500 (Thu, 18 Apr 2013) | 61 lines

Fixed issues saving new items with 'usr_choice'
(or 'pub_choice') access style (like regions
and points, which can be made public or private).
- style_change was not getting set right on the
  commit, or even processed right when it was
  set right... oh, yeah, this code was never
  debugged until now....

Fixed route 'history', or list of recently
viewed routes.
- Added item_findability table to enhance and
  replace route_view (route_views) table.
- Replaced CcpV1's route history get and route
  histor put (which didn't do the same thing:
  get would fetch the list of recent routes,
  and put would mark a route as having been
  recently viewed): now, getting the list of
  recently viewed routes is just a normal item
  checkout cmd, and route history put is replaced
  by item_finability_put (and a new get to
  actually get the settings, so the user
  can now determine an item's visibility, i.e.,
  so routes linked from a route reaction are
  publicly accessible but don't necessarily show
  up in the public route library).
- The route history is all maintained on the
  server now, so using the paginator is simple.
  In CcpV1, the route history was fetched once-
  when the user logged on- and the history was
  thereafter maintained by flashclient (in one
  long list, and clicking a route would immed.
  sent that route to the top of the list...).
  In CcpV2/3/n?, route history is fetched in
  pages by the server using the item_findability
  table and also by looking for new routes with
  matching session IDs (so, i.e., an anonymous
  user can request a route, the user can login,
  and then the user can claim the route and
  save it).
- New query_filters options:
    findability_ignore
      can be used by user to find routes they
      have hidden from their route library.
    findability_recent
      used by the route history panel so it
      can use normal checkout cmd; server
      will join routes against item_findability
      to filter on recent routes the user has
      viewed.
    gia_use_sessid
      to also find items by session ID; was
      implemented in pyserver but wasn't an
      enabled query_filters option until now
- The item_findability is used by the 'restricted'
  access style widget, to let the user configure
  how items are shared (via item library, Web
  link, being part of a discussion, etc.).

Ccp.py now sends a session ID. And pyserver now
actually verifies the client's ID is a valid UUID.

Access_Style:
- Cleaned up (removed obsolete options).
- Added pub_choice to complement usr_choice:
  both mean user is allowed to make new items
  public or private before saving, but usr_choice
  means default is usr_editor, and pub_choice means
  default is pub_editor (and by suggested default I
  mean that's what flashclient uses when the user
  creates the new item; the user can still toggle
  permissions between public and private until they
  save).

Fixed issue with --branch -1 from scripts (revision
gids were not getting initialized).

Flashclient: If you use route library filters while
map is loading, flashclient was not canceling old
library requests, so the last response was populating
the list. Now we cancel outstanding requests when a
new request is sent.

Flashclient: Clicking on emptiness in item details
panel removes focus from input controls.

Flashclient: Finished implementing sharing widget
views. Lots and lots of changes. I still have to
wire the widgets to response (e.g., send gwis req).
Added a copy-to-clipboard icon and functionality
for the stealth secret / web link.

Flashclient: Don't automatically fade out/minimize
tool palette when it's first shown.

Flaschlient: Fixed problem changing panels and old
active panel activating again (because active_panel
and effectively_active_panel weren't being used right).

Flashclient: Lots of cleanup to clone_() commands,
which are more of an update fcn -- it's called to
update local item copies with new data from the
database. We need to keep the original local items
because there are lots of object references to them.
So don't clone everything, but just update what data
you know if fresher and from the server (and not
locally generated).

Biggies:

  1. Recent Changes panel overhaul and fixes.

  2. Map defaults to not 'Allow Editing', and tool palette
     is hidden on startup.  Most item details panel widgets
     are non-editable is this mode (though this'll change
     in the future, as we determine which widgets should be
     useable).

Details:

A few bugfixes to pyserver for recent change gwis:
- Fixed getting geomsummary for group_revision.
- Code wasn't assembling group_revision group_ids, since
  there can be more than one group_id returned and client
  theneeds a list for each revision.
- A typo in filter_by_username.

A track.py typo Fernando pointed out.

Flashclient:

Wired 'Allow Editing' and default editing palette to being
hidden. It fades in when the user enables editing.

Default Point and Region to be named 'Unnamed [item type]'
so we don't have to throw a modal up asking for the name
(which is very disruptive and rude).
- Also animate a little red highlight around the name box
  indicating to the user that they should edit the name.

Overhauled recent changes panel. Much cleaner, better
mouse-list-button interactions, better background when
selected (we draw a custom background color which messes up
the DataGrid's background it draws when a row is selected).

Also lots of fixes and beautifications of item details panel for
both Current/Working and Historic revisions.

Details:

* Fix Historic
  - Fix problems reloading revision (in Update_Revision and elsewhere).
  - Fix usage of rev_viewport and rev_workcopy and introduce
    rev_loadnext to help when changing revisions.
  - Fix disabling of map tools in historic mode, also fix widgets to
    hide editable and to display non-editable controls in historic mode.
  - Fix item cleanup when doing meticulous cleanup.

* Fix de-selecting items -- was first crashing on any deselect,
  and then crashing on final deselect, for many different reasons.

* Clean up logger names to be no more than 12 chars wide.
  - Also cleaned up some trace messages not to be so cluttery
    and to do a better job pretty-print-wrapping.

* Rename G.map.mode to G.map.rmode (it's for route reactions, hence
  'r'mode) to better tell it apart from all the other 'mode's.

A flock of flashclient fixes:

* Applied Mikhil's UI style on route-finder panel to item
  details panel and its widgets:
  - More whitespace and padding, larger section labels.
  - Using CSS to make tweaking style easy.

* Added Item_Stack class to flashclient.
  - It's not part of the item class hierarchy like in
    pyserver, but only created when needed, i.e., only
    when a user selects an item and we lazy-load more
    details about the item.

* A tiny bit of panel_item/* renaming.

* Fixed/Finished item details panel widgets:
  - Delete item from map
  - Merge selected roads
  - View discussions about item (this is why I split
    out item_stack, so we can lazy-load discussions
    counts)
  - Lots of fixes to sharing widget and to
    calculating selected items' access_style_id

Pyserver fixes and such:

* Tweaked last checkin's fetching of item type
  'Item_User_Access' to now allow fetching of
  'Geofeature' so client can lazy-load annotations
  and discussions counts (for the item details
  panel's discussion widget).

* Fixed query_filters' "do_load_lval_counts", which
  was only working if not "dont_load_feat_attcs",
  but the two should be able to run independently.

* Moved some pyserver/* folders to pyserver/bin:
  - rpy2    low-level R-interface; was maybe originally
            used for early route analysis code, but now
            unused, unless Milhil uses it
  - winpdb  remote python debugger, used regularly by
            Landon
  - rpdb    another remote python debugger, new to
            Landon

Pyserver:

  * Add class attribute, child_item_types, so we can
    checkout intermediate item types (i.e., ask for
    geofeature by stack ID without knowing the type
    of geofeature). This is so the client can get an
    item's access_style without getting the rest of
    the item and so we don't have to write a new cmd.
    (Also added static fcn. get_class_item_lookup
    so we can get the item aggregator via the class.)

  * The branch_hier's leafiest tuple's revision should
    usually be the same as the query_builder's. That is,
    for revision.Current and revision.Historic,
    id(qb.branch_hier[0][1]) == id(qb.revision)

Branches:

  * The branch class does a better job setting
    qb.branch_hier_limit and now behaves like the other
    item types on checkout -- return all branches unless
    the user supplies filters.

  * When making a new branch, use rid_new, not rid_max.

Scripts:

  * Fix branch_coverage_area_update for V1->V2 upgrade.

Grammar:

  * "Descendent" is really spelled descendant.
    Remember: "Ants" have descendants, but who's ever heard
    of an "ent"? Probably only fans of fantasy, or doctors
    of the ear, nost, and throat.

Everything:

  * Sorry, I'm being OCD: For parallelism with similar
    variables, I've renamed instances of 'access_style'
    to 'access_style_id'. (This checkin already requires a
    database update so might as well sneak this in, too...)

Flashclient:

  * Detect if user is in a specific group and show a
    special icon in the banner area if so. We fire an
    event now when the group_memberships are loaded.
    * Members of the Cycloplan group now see Cycloplan and
      Met Council icons.

  * Move views.panel_item_branch to views.panel_branch.
    Also, some misc. updates to the Branch panel and to
    the Sharing widgets.

  * Fix scrolling and scrollbar problem with route item
    panel's TabNavigator (we have to calculate exact
    heights for TabNavigator dataProviders based on
    other components' heights).

  * Fix Query_Filters.equals: it wasn't using array_eqq,
     but was comparing Array == Array, ha!
    And, double ha, array_eqq itself was also broken.
    Oops, triple d'oh, Set.contains_any
     was using 'for' instead of 'for each'.

  * Fix repopulate() ordering so parents are repopulated
    before children widgets (the problem was triggered by
    the sharing widget, which needs data that Panel_Item_Versioned
    assembles in repopulate()). Also fixed some inconsistencies between
    on_panel_show/on_panel_hide and on_show_event/on_hide_event.

  * Lazy-load access_style_id when item is selected. I've
    got it wired to the sharing widget, which still needs
    to be implemented.

# *** Database update

DEVS: You need to do a quick database update.

Your easiest solution is to run a script I've got on huffy.

  psql -U cycling [your_ccpv3_database] < /scratch/huffy/ccp/dev/cp_2628/2013.04.05.ccpv3_trunk-r29933.sql

Your other option is to do it manually:

  INSERT INTO item_type (id, type_name) VALUES (50, 'item_user_access');

  ALTER TABLE new_item_policy RENAME COLUMN access_style TO access_style_id;

  ALTER TABLE item_stack RENAME COLUMN access_style TO access_style_id;

  DROP VIEW nip;
  DROP FUNCTION public.cp_access_style_id (IN style_name TEXT);
  DROP FUNCTION cp_group_make_private_group(TEXT, INT, INT, INT, INT);
  DROP FUNCTION cp_group_membership_new(INTEGER, TEXT, INTEGER, INTEGER, INTEGER, INTEGER, INTEGER);

  # MANUALLY: Search the codebase for the three CREATE FUNCTIONS and the one CREATE VIEW.

Pyserver-

* Allow item_stack to have unset access_style -- it just means
  user cannot change item permissions (but user can still edit
  and delete item).

* Fix assert in attachment with filter_by_nearby_edits.

* The item_stack table requires access_style now, just because.
  It's not really necessary for the code, but it requires devs
  to think twice about what they're doing.

Flashclient-

* Fix multiple problems creating new tag and then deleting it.
  Also fix saving and deleting tags and link_value-tags.

* Fix Do/Undo/Redo stack bugs.

* On do or undo or redo, go to the panel of the affected items
  and alter the panel's selection set and the map selection to
  reflect the affected items.

* Fix Save button (and dirty map calculation) to account for
  orphaned attachments (i.e., new tags or new annotations
  with no link values, e.g., make a new tag with a unique
  name and then delete it: the Save Changes button should
  be disabled).

* New depopulate() fcn. to run instead of repopulate() if no
  items are selected. I kept having problems with repopulate
  failing because this.items_selected was null or empty (the
  problems tend to happen on logout, presumably because all
  the items get discarded and maybe their panels are not
  cleaned up? anyway, some detail panels' repopulate()
  implementations blindly assume this.items_selected is set
  and nonzero items long).

DEVS: If "Filter by what is visible in the map" times out
      your link_value table is probably missing some
      indices.
        See: ccpv2-add_constraints.sql

* Fix problem creating new thread and
  displaying new thread panel (was not
  initializing new item via grac manager).

* Add lhs/rhs name to link_value checkout,
  so item_watcher links can tell user what
  name of linked item is.

* If user closes a panel and panel is not
  destroyed, panel_close_pending was not
  being reset, so next time panel was
  activated, it would close when you
  switched tabs.

* Fixed problem with User Account dropdown
  not resetting selectedIndex so you
  could not, e.g., choose the Item Alert
  link twice in a row (since a dropdown
  doesn't send you an event if user selects
  what's already selected).

  and classes.

Item Watching (Item Alerts) Implementation

* New script link_attributes_populate.py (500 beautiful
  lines I wrote last night!) converts the temporary
  item_watcher_bug_nnnn table into private link_values
  between the /item/alert_email attribute and whatever
  items the users are watching.

* Relax only_lhs_stack_ids contraint in checkout:
  We used to not let the user specify an lhs stack
  ID and ask for all of the link_values because
  this could be a very large query (think asking
  for all speed_limits without specifying a bbox:
  you'd get all byways' speed_limit link_values).
  But item_watching is a private attribute, and
  the item watcher panel shows all of a users'
  watchers, so we need to support this type of
  checkout now (in the future, we might want to
  make a list of "okay" lhs stack IDs and not
  allow checkout on the others without a bbox.
  That, or we should use LIMIT on search results.

* New new_item_policy records for item watcher
  attribute link_values. Now you can specify
  an attribute name and the setup script will
  resolve it to the attribute's stack ID (used
  as the nip's link_left_stack_id).

* search_by_stack_id now returns item_type_id
  so callers can figure out an item type given
  a stack ID.

Statewide UI:

* Oops, I had m4_ASSERT() in search_map; replaced
  with g.assurt().

* Fix Account_Control dropdown's Log Out and Item
  Alerts wiring -- the callbacks were failing to
  fire.

* Started reimplementation of Item Watcher panel.
  When the panel is activated, it sends a GWIS
  checkout and asks the server for all of the
  user's /item/alert_email link_values, which
  is the list of all of the user's item watchers.

Branch: br/masli_statewide-ui-discussions_2784

[ Skipping r29838 to r29850 (is just a merge from CcPV3 trunk). ]

Changes from Mikhil:

* Fix item_read_event_put to store system ID, not stack ID.
  This fixes server assert when viewing discussion posts.

* Misc. fixes to link-route (attaching routes to posts).

* Other minor fixes for discussions and reactions.

Changes from Landon:

* Fixed a problem with stealth secret -- item_stack table
  should be joined in the inner SQL clause.

* Reworked changes to search_map.py (code from [mm] that [lb]
  hadn't actually checked in...). We want geocoded results to
  come first, like in Ccpv1, and we want to return both geocoded
  results and database results together, not just one or the other.

* Panel tabs named after item type now (suggested by [mm]).

Statewide UI fixes:

* On Item Details Panel, notes were not loading until
  the second time you viewed a panel (e.g., click item
  on map and item details panel shows, click on empty
  space in map, then click item again).

  - Problem was the widgets marked dirty were not
    having their repopulate() called. The idea is
    that a widget can listen on events (such as 
    notes having been loaded) and repopulate()
    themselves, without bothering to repopulate()
    the entire panel (and all other widgets).

* Minor fixes to Manage Attributes widget on
  branch details panel.

Statewide UI fixes:

Lots of item selection and detail panel fixes:

- Closing route details panel was failing if
  you were looking at the route panel.

  - You can now open multiple route panels and
    close them whether they're the active panel
    or not.

- Fixed Route_List issues (on route library panel
  and recently viewed routes panel):

  - The original, non-hydrated route was not
    being added to Geofeature.all, and when
    you clicked a route in the list, the new,
    hydrated route was living alongside the
    old, non-hydrated route.

  - Fixed problem closing route panel and route
    sprite not being removed from map (and client
    crashing if you clicked the sprite with no
    route and no panel).

  - Fixed crash when searching route library -- the
    route list being returned was conflicting with
    routes already in memory. Now, we either ignore
    the route list route or we update the existing
    route.

- Fixed bugs selecting map items (byways, points)
  and making multiple item selections and changing
  selection sets by clicking items on the map or
  tab bar buttons in the side_panel.

  - There was a bug with the custom attribute gridrow
    renderer -- after removeAllChildren, we have to
    callLater before addChild can be called, otherwise
    a Flex callLater throws a null exception.

At this point, you should be able to make item selections
and view routes, and to change the active panel, close
panels, etc., without any crashes.

Merge from Mikhil's br/masli_statewide-ui-more_2766:
  revisions 29790 through 29812

* See Bug 2782 more notes about the merge.

  http://bugs.cyclopath.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2782

* Changing target flash version from Flash 9 to Flash 10.

  See comments and useful SQL in mxmlc-config.xml.

* Added support for generating PDFs. Uses third-party
  PDF libraries and third-party JPEGEncoder replacement
  for Adobe's JPGEncoder.

  ** See Bug 2783 - Statewide UI: Dynamically load PDF libraries

     http://bugs.cyclopath.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2783

     We need to update auto_install with the new libraries,
     and we need to dynamically load the libraries (otherwise
     our main.swf increases from 1.5 Mb to 2.6 Mb).

* Various UI changes:

  ** Route list key now shared between library and recently-viewed tabs.

  ** Moved route feedback widget above all route tabs.

  ** Make tag preferences help toggleable (and collapsed by default).

  ** Replace Search panel back/fwd with proper paginator widget.

  ** Fix route panel cue sheet grid.

  ** Move some common route buttons from details tab to below all tabs.

Some changed from Landon:

* Fixed paddingRight when verticalScrollPolicy="auto" and
  scroll bar comes and goes: when it becomes visible, it
  messes up the paddingRight such that our components touch
  the edge of the scroll bar, so now we add paddingRight.

* On the settings panel I added a dropdown to select the layout style.
  I.e., [mm]'s or [lb]'s. Called Breezy and Squary. Breezy for Mikhil's
  since it utilizes more whitespace than [lb]'s, Squary, which uses more
  box outlines.

Statewide UI: Continuing implementation and bug fixing of
the new tab bar buttons and their panels.

In this checkin:

  Each panel now has its own items_selected and feats_selected.

  * For Geofeatures, items_selected === feats_selected.

  * For Attachments, items_selected is the one attachment to which
    the panel belongs, and feats_selected is the selection set on
    the map (of Geofeatures).

  * For all other panels, items_selected is empty and feats_selected
    is the map selection, if the panel supports a map selection.

For the most part G.map.selectedset is the same as feats_selected.
With exceptions.

What's not working:

  Clicking items and switching panels -- which should update
  G.map.selectedset based on the panel's feats_selected -- is
  still very buggy.

  But the code at least compiles.

  Just know you'll get lots of runtimes!

  [lb] also left some left-justified priority fixmes that'll
  need to be cleaned up.
  [ compare: meld cp_trunk_v3 ccpv3_29803 & ]

  ** The state changes in the Panel_Item_* classes is not fixed
  (I got rid of a state change in a base class). See
  Panel_Item_Route (and its base class, Panel_Item_Geofeature)
  for an example of changes that need to propagate to the
  other item panel classes.

Overhauled TileCache and MapServer scripts.

- Now, tilecache.cfg and the wms.map file are generated by
  custom Python scripts. This is to get around some
  limitations with LAYER in MapServer, and limititations
  to how you can config layers in tilecache.cfg.

- Fixed tag problem -- there's now a "cluster" cache that
  coalesces connected byways with the same name and makes
  one long line segment. We still need to tweak how the
  label priority is determined, however.

- Lots of performance improvements... possibly with more
  to come.

  - Increased metasize from 3 to 20. This means TileCache
    asks MapServer to make a tile 20 times larger on each
    edge, and then TileCache chops it up into 400 smaller
    tiles of the desired size. This means there are 400
    times fewer database calls, and less separate rendering.
    Note that 20 is the ideal value only based on empherical
    evidence; this value might need to be decreased or
    increased for some machines (I've only tested on my
    laptop).

  - Fixed the line segment cache so it stores information
    about "embellishments" (i.e., bike facility, restricted,
    etc.) which greatly simplifies the MapServer SQL (so it
    doesn't have to join a bunch of tables).

- Implemented locking mechanisms. In CcpV1 on the live site,
  we only call tilecache update every 15 minutes, so that
  we can avoid overlapped calls, I assume. Now, the script
  can be called every minute, and it aborts quickly if it
  sees that it's already running. Also, developers can run
  the script themselves, and table row locks prevent working
  on the same branch cache simultaneously (so you don't have
  to disable the cron script if you want to run the script
  manually).

- Adding branch skinning and leafy branch tile creation! I.e.,
  now the Metc Bikeways branch on runic gets its own set of
  tiles. Also, it's easy to change the tile look-n-feel, and
  we can support multiple looks-n-feels for each branch, as 
  desired.

- Fixed/Automated branch bbox calculation. That is, in CcpV1,
  the coverage_area table was used to filter geocoded results.
  Also, there was a bbox in tilecache.cfg. But neither of these
  were ever updated (and there was no note anywhere indicating
  we should keep these values up to date). Now, the new cron
  script, check_cache_now.sh, calls gen_tilecache_cfg.py, which
  makes sure the bbox is up to date.

Some fixes and updates to pyserver based on aforementioned
TileCache script changes.

- Also, fixed route finding, which was broke (though not sure
  when -- the SQL was still referencing byway_node and not
  node_endpoint). There was also incorrect usage of the qb.
  (I think when I merged route reactions I messed this up.)

Flashclient is a bit of a mess. I'm working on the Item
Details panels and fixing the permissions widget, among
other improvements. I'll check in this code next, and then
I want to merge Mikhil's Statewide UI changes...

Changed SVN references from frost.cs to runic.cs, since
frost is MIA.

Consolidate specialized --groups script_args behavior:
now a class attr, and specifying special group 0 includes
both 'All Users' public group and _anon_user_[instance]
private group. CLI scripts can also now specify if they
expect just one group name or ID.

Long time no check in!

Fixed MapServer and TileCache.

Two new cache tables:
 * one for byways for which to make tiles;
 * and another for labels for which to label byways.

Respeks permissions and branching (i.e., one set of tiles for each branch).

Revamped skin file. Should be easier to make new color and design schemes for tiles.

Made mapfile-maker script to hack around MapServer limitations: new map file is 282842 lines long! Hooray for LAYERs!!

* V1->V2 Schema scripts: Add new well-known groups: one for session
  IDs and one for stealth secrets.

  ** By adding well-known groups, we can let the owner of a route
     specify specific permissions for people with the stealth UUID,
     i.e., in CcpV1, sharing a link would always give people just
     viewer access to an item and then the owner could not change
     those permissions. In CcpV2, owners can give viewer or editor
     access to a UUID link, and they can even mark UUID access
     denied, if they want.

  ** The session ID group is used to give arbiter access to items
     created by anonymous users. The user has arbiter access so long
     as their session ID is active.

* Simplified access level: removed stealth as an access level, since
  it makes more sense to use a special stealth user group and then
  to assign a real access level, like viewer or editor.

* Route Planner: bugfixes. The Routed Planner p1 seems to work now:
  you can request a route and it seems to get saved with the proper
  permissions (i.e., if you're anonymous, a session ID GIA record
  is created).

  ** The flashclient is not wired to change permissions, or to use
     the new style_change options.

* Flashclient Update_* classes: added some events so we can wait
  until the map loads before we waste bandwidth and cycles loading
  less important data, like latest activity and the route library
  (that is, we want the map tiles to be drawn as soon as possible
  on application start). There's still a little more work to be
  done to get tiles loaded faster, but this is a start...

* Misc. Flashclient fixes to UI widgets and whatnots.

   components, and fixed the height of the DataGrids

    to render themselves before you can set the appropriate
    aggregate height).

REGARDING: There's a Big Bug in [the last] code drop.

           It's fixed.

           See: Bug 2764 - Flex bug?: Default
           horizontalScrollPolicy causing two minutes
           of blocking, memory-gobbling activity.

ALSO FIXED:

* A derived class was changing State and then the base
  class was changing State to one of the derived class'
  state. But since the parent class went first, the 
  effect was nilled. This was a cxpx error.

* Changed lingering names named WFS to GWIS.

* Added some explicit removeEventListener calls.

* Fixes to spam.py, emails_for_spam.py, and related fcns.
  in user.py.

PARTIALLY ADDRESSED:

* Bug 2763: No funny email addresses.

* Starting to fix view problems, cmd problems, etc. caused
  by the route sharing and route reactions code merge. That
  is to say, I've tested loading the application and looking
  at panels. The tiles load and features load when you zoom
  in. I haven't tested anything else, and you'll see some
  empty lists (e.g., the routes list).

//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//

WARNING: There's a Big Bug in this code drop.

It may also exist in earlier checkins that broke
Flashclient, since this is the first time since adding
route reactions and maybe route sharing that I've been
able to load Flashclient.

But on load, Flashclient spins for 1m54s, gobbling
memory and CPU, before finally loading tiles.

I'm not sure what's looping, since there was a lot of
code from route reactions and route sharing. It could
be anywhere!

Hopefully, this problem can be solved by using the flash
debugger, a/k/a fdb.

//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//*//

Client updates:

* Remove specialized GWIS_Route_Feedback_Ask_Me_Later.as
  and GWIS_Route_Share.as and just use GWIS_Commit.as.

* Replace Page_Selector with Paginator_Widget.

* Don't reload map on save -- update new items with their
  new permanent stack ID, and then checkout all the saved
  items and update them in the background.

* Lots and lots of little fixes to get new route reactions
  and route sharing code to run.

r29427 | landonb | 2012-11-12 19:50:01 -0600 (Mon, 12 Nov 2012) | 32 lines


Lots of server updates:

* Universal support for saving anonymously even when logged
  in (a/k/a anon_coward).

* Renamed thread_id to thread_stack_id.
  Renamed context_item_id to context_stack_id.

* Inverted qb.filters.dont_load_lval_counts (now
  qb.filters.do_load_lval_counts) since the client doesn't
  always want it and its costly to calculate.

* New filters option, max_access_level, to handle route
  library list requests.

* A few filters were being incorrectly prepared by ccp.py.

* post.One objects now have a reference to the thread.One
  object, rather than just its stack_id.

* New thread_type.py class to complement route reaction's
  ttype attribute (which indicates if a thread and its
  posts are a general discussion or a route reaction
  discussion).

* When loading routes, creating XML was failing because
  geometry was empty string instead of None. So I loosened
  things to not be so strict (i.e., don't just check if 
  not None, but also if not '').

Replace db_clone with db_lite: db_clone did a simple pg_dump and pg_restore, but you should instead just pg_dump and postgis_restore (which is two easy commands, so really no need for a shell script wrapper; new db_lite script calls pg_dump and excludes heavy tables (like apache_event_session, log_event, etc.), uses postgis_restore to load the partial database, then pg_dumps the missing tables' schema and pg_restores said missing schema.

Flashclient bug: Item Access tab control crashes if two or 
more items selected on map.

Update tilecache/mapserver script to use new base classes, 
and to fix regression bugs since the byway_node table was

* Found a bug in item_user_access SQL that sometimes did not
  add sql_clauses.outer.where clause.

Fixed a bug in MetC update with the 'name' field.

* Also some other bugs.

* Moved some commands to a base class to support the export

Fixed a ton of issues with saving split-from byways.

 * Both commit.py and merge_import.py assemble all 
   the stack IDs of byways being saved that are 
   split-from.

   * The link_values, permissions, and a couple 
     other associated pieces of information are 
     now replicated for each of the split-from 
     byways.

   * The permissions code is Very Tricky and most 
     likely Very Buggy. (I've tested the import 
     script on parts of the MetC import, and they 
     sometimes work and sometimes don't; I haven't 
     tested committing yet, either.)

BUG nnnn: I found a bug with group_item_access records 
for link_values whose value is NULL at some point -- 
the gia record does not exist. I added some code to 
the schema update scripts (v1->v2) to investigate this 
further.

Lots of updates to byway_node.py.

 * Got rid of elevation.py, and moved it into 
   byway_node.py

 * Made byway_node.One and byway_node.Many, like 
   most other item classes, but byway_node is 
   *special* -- it has no group_item_access rows.
   Users are allowed to access the nodes of whatever 
   byways they can access.

 * Added all the byway_nodes to byway (so when you 
   checkout a byway you get all the byway_nodes 
   columns, including dangle_ok, reference_n, 
   and elevation). You can now edit these values 
   using the import mechanism (and someday hopefully 
   using flashclient).

Lots of import updates:

 * Now supports all byway columns and associate links
   (import formerly just supported MetC attributes).

 * Exported shapefiles can be reimported (not that I've 
   tested, but the import compares what's in the import 
   shapefile to what's in the database and figures out 
   if anything's changed and what needs to be saved).

 * Byways are now bulk-loaded, using one SQL statement 
   for all byways instead of one for each. Will this 
   speed things up?

Some item class changes:

 * __init__ can be used to clone items, using copy_from.

 * save_insert can be used to 'update' existing rows 
   (by deleting the old row and recreating the new row).

   * This is necessary for split-from byways created in 
     a new branch, since we copy the old link_values 
     first but then need to update them -- and pyserver
     has never needed to do an SQL UPDATE until now.

Added pythonpath back to conf.py since psycopg2 is 
now installed locally (I didn't want to bother/wait 
for Systems...). 

 * This means 

     import conf
     import g

   *must* come before 

     import psycopg2

Renamed start_node_id to beg_node_id to better 
parallel end_node_id ('beg' is three letters like
'end', and 'beg' comes before 'end' alphabetically;
a similar scheme is used for valid_start/until_rid).

1. GrAC bugfixes.

* Relaxed some assurts I added recently that were tickled by 
running ./ccp.py to create new branch, group, and group memberships.

* Fixed a problem with new_item_policy's access_existing, which 
I also recently added and was triggered by running ./ccp.py to 
update the new branch.

2. Made generic Path_Helper module to use UUID to find a unique 
filename or directory path. Needed by the import code to work 
with zipfiles and shapefiles.

* Includes third-party portalocker module, which is used to 
lock a file to guarantee the UUID filename stays unique.

3. Lots and lots of little bugfixes to the import hierarchy: 
the old MetC import code is all wired and seems to complete 
without fail now! (I've only tested ten loop-iterations-deep
with a rollback, so I haven't tested the whole, 3 hour-long op.)

Some import bugfixes, though mostly Hardening error handling. Specifically: getting raised errors to print their stack trace, which is apparently a bit tricky in Python. I changed all 1,025 calls to the built-in assert() to call g.assurt() instead (don't worry, I used Vim's bufdo to do the replacement). When work items fail, the stack trace is stored in the job object, so devs can get at it. And now all the asserts in pyserver are much more meaningful (they oftentimes would print blank lines to the log file).

Lots more bug fixes to the import framework. The yaml 
file, ccp.yml, seems in good shape. All the permissions 
for the branch and the groups and whatnot are checked.
The custom callback is finally reached. And now asserts 
work.

Figured out how to process asserts and print out a 
meaningful stack trace! (Ok, so it involves overloading 
AssertionError and defining our own class -- g.assurt -- 
and messing around with the traceback module, but, hey, 
it works.)

Three misspellings of 'isintance'.

Consolidated variable name used by 'except'. Was using 
e or x, but decided upon just 'e' (as in 'error' or 
'exception', e.g., 'except Exception, e:'). Also, 'x' 
is already used as a temp var for most list expansions.

Fixed usages of re.compile to use themselves and not 
call re.merge(), i.e., my_compiled_re.merge() instead.

It was a bool, now an enum; was None, True, or False, now None, 0, 1 or 2. 0 is like False, 2 like True, and 1 means the GML attr is only required on item create. (II) Also: lots and lots of changes to the GRAC code. Decoupled self.req so work_queue (which isn't run via Apache) can access same GRAC code (without having to spoof an Apache request object).

The orig. Metc import script had dozens of options, some 
hard-coded and some CLI options. I moved everything to 
a Yaml config file that gets zipped with the shapefiles.
This generalizes the import script and should allow us 
to easily work with shapefiles with different fields, etc.

I also split the 5K, single file, formerly-custom-MetC
import script into a handful of hierarchical class
files. This de-couples a lot of the code and should make
working with the import code a lot, lot easier as we
continue developing it. (The files are smaller (~ 1K or
smaller each), most of the fcns. in each file are only
called from within that file, and some files contain much
more stable code than others (so most files we won't
continue to develop, just the ones closer to the top).)

Be warned: this checkin is broken. I'll debug and checkin 
again after going for a ride... in the beautiful three 
degrees F weather ;).

Now, the command calls into the MetC import script, and confix yml has additional params to help figure out what type of conflation to do and what the shapefile names and layers are. Next, I'll be updating the MetC code to check the type of conflation (roadmatcher vs. cyclopath) and teaching it how to work with the work queue so it can periodically check if it needs to halt processing.

Fixed race condition running job from ccp.py:

- an assert was throwing and the exception routine 
  was trying to get the same row lock that the 
  job handler still had. So I wrap a try/except in 
  the job handler so it can release the lock if/when
  it throws.

Fixed a problem checking out branches from flashclient:

- when changing branches, it was clearing group memberships 
  without re-requesting them. Now, group memberships are only 
  forgotten when the user logs in or out, but not when changing
  branches.

Added a bunch of __ne__ fcns. to pyserver to complement the 
existing __eq__ fcns:

- the sql builder was calling != on the sql clauses but we had

Can now test work_item and merge_job requests 
using ccp.py, which speeds up debugging (you 
don't have to load the work queue thread and 
flashclient every time you want to test) and 
makes debugging simpler (the work queue threads 
don't report AssertionErrors very well (the 
stack trace is informationless)).

* Without the third-party 'poster' module, we 
cannot send multi-part content with urllib2, 
so we just fake a local file transfer. We also 
set the work item to 'starting' immediately, 
which prevents the work queue (if the service 
is running) from processing our new job. Then, 
pyserver returns to us the new stack_id (it 
sends a client ID => stack ID lookup) so we 
can find the job and send it to a fake Mr. Do!
service that we start in the context of ccp.py.

Updated the flashclient Makefile to make ctags 
for two missing Python source directories, 
services/ and scripts/.

Beginnings of genericizing the MetC Bikeways 
import. See services/merge/import_*.

WARNING: There's a race condition I still need 
to debug. E.g.,

  ./ccp.py -U landonb --no-password -c -t merge_job -m "Ignored." \
     -b "Metc Bikeways 2011 - Test 01" \
     -e download_fake "/ccp/dev/test.zip" \
     -e name "" \
     -e job_act "create" \
     -e for_group_id 0 \
     -e for_revision 0 \
     -e job_local_run 1

hangs in Mr. Do!

I implemented- what's it called? Gen 3 of the Item Watcher 
code. (Gen 1 being CcpV1 and Gen 2 being some code I wrote 
last year which isn't quite right.)

- Rather than being part of the item hierarchy (which was 
  really cumbersome and created extra overhead), item
  watchers are now nonwiki items.
  
  * Nonwiki items are stored just like item_versioned items 
    but they only have one copy in the database, whose
    version is always 1 and whose start and until revision IDs
    are always 1 and infinity, respectively.

- Some advantages:

  * Nonwiki Items -- and now Item Watchers -- can be saved 
    outside of the normal save-map button. The client can
    send an out-of-band save, and the server will create a
    new Item Watcher Change, which is basically the trick
    we employ to quasi-version nonwiki items (that is,
    changes to nonwiki items are still stored, kind of 
    like tag preferences in CcpV1).

  * Nonwiki items are a lot less coupled to the database 
    than versioned items. For those attributes we don't 
    want to search or sort on, we pickle (or marshall or
    flatten) the attributes into a single database cell. 
    So we can now make changes to Item Watchers a lot 
    more easily.

    + For instance, we could let the user configure 
      additional types of item watchers, like one that 
      sends you an SMS or sends a tweet, and we do not 
      need to modify the database at all!

    + This same approach can be used to store user 
      settings without having to add new columns or 
      tables to the database for every little change 
      to user settings -- if we store a pickled python 
      object, we can make changes to the python class 
      without having to touch the database.

  * In the future, we can use the same framework for 
    ratings. If we make ratings into Nonwiki items, we 
    can save them in the background without requiring 
    the user to hit the save map button.

I hardened the checkout code to do a better job checking
that the request won't produce hundreds or thousands of
records (I saw this issue debugging a problem checking 
out regions -- I got thousands of link_values back and 
my client brought my machine to a grind).

- This also made me see that discussions still had a 
  bug. I had fixed some requests to fetch pages of 
  threads, but on startup it was still fetching the 
  complete thread list.

Fixed checking out items user is watching.

Fixed checking out items by region name.

Fixed: List not being updated when new items received:
filter regions and waypoints by tags.

Fixed Region AutoComplete widgets (labelField wasn't set...).

More tweaks to Recent Changes interface.

Added Region AutoComplete to Merge panel (so when you schedule 
an export-map job you can specify the region to export).

Fixed the group dropdown on the Merge panel. It was a stub -- 
just a fake list. Now it shows all the users to which the 
user belongs, and it also shows the group access scope.

Added email-me option to Merge import jobs. (Okay, I added 
the checkbox; item watchers is still broken in the client.
And the server.)

Fixed a weird layout problem on the item access panel. The 
label wasn't being drawn, and the combobox was being clipped 
by the next row in the list.

Started changing some of the AutoComplete widget widths from 
hard-coded to based-on-something-else. The third-party code 
for the AutoComplete widget doesn't do percent-based widths, 
so we need a trick to make 'em look good, know what I mean?

Ok, so, I've been living in flashclient for a while. I loves 
to tweak me a good gooey. I swear my next checkin will be an 
import or export script for Merge jobs......................

Lots of fixes to commit.

Lots of decoupling.

* Moved code clutter from general panel manager 
  class to new *_Manager.as classes.

* Got rid of the 'stype' hack from V1 discussions.

* Moved a lot of fcns. from G.as to two new pkgs., 
  utils.geom.Geometry.as and views.Paint.as.

Fixed a few bugs with the task queue.

* When a new work item step is added, tickle the 
  task manager (open a socket and send the 'kick'
  command).
  
Added the paginator to discussions and recent 
changes. Not fully implemented, but sorta.

De-static'ed two classes. Or maybe it's called 
de-singletoning.

Change Dirty_Reason collections from expensive
Set2 objects to bitmasked uints.

Tweaks to the Merge Jobs list, esp.: now the lists shows the percentage progress of jobs as they are processed. Also implemented file downloads (it was mostly stubbed before). There's a new item type that dervies from the nonwiki item, but it masquerades as the same item type. This means the same SQL is used to fetch the item and, more importantly, that the user is checked to make sure they have view-access on the item. Then, instead return the item details as XML, the download file is returned instead.

A few milestones[1]: 
  * Work Queue Service
  * Work Item State Manager

The Work Queue service, henceforth called Mr. Do!, 
starts a specified number of threads and processes 
tasks as they are plopped in the work_item table.

It is a powerful resource-management tool that 
handles the heavy lifting of geodata processing 
while also offering good quality of service to 
casual Web users and other clients using the system.

The Work Item State Manager handles transitioning 
work items between states as well as finding the 
list of hot jobs for the work queue to process.
Currently, it picks one job of each type for 
each branch. In the future, we may wiss to design 
a more full-featured system for prioritizing and 
processing clients' jobs.

[1]: Milestone Caveat: The Work Queue service has 
     not been debugged. It's 1K-ish lines new code.
     Yet Too Be Bugfixed. And hopefully before the 
     holidays... I got other fish to fry, and tofu
     to turkey.

Tons of fixes to work items.

Implement Merge_Job class.

Implement work_item_step.

Removed job_class from Query_Builder and instead just use 
item_type. That is, like, use the normal checkout and 
commit commands to deal with merge_job, study_job, and 
future work item types. Which are essential justs items.
Well, nonwiki items, which are not revisioned, but as 
items we can apply group access control and branching 
to them without writing new code.

Lots of changes to pyserver.

Making new items now get qb object so they can search 
database if necessary. I.e., for work_item_steps, when 
you load a work_item, it needs to load its steps.

BIG CHANGE: Upgrade to psycopg2!

This entailed changing sql() calls to always use %s and
never to use %d.

cPickle! is being used to pack job options so we don't 
have to make explicit database table columns. The 
disadvantage is these options are not sortable and don't 
work with pageination, kinda, but that's totally cool 
because there are a ton of options and it doesn't make 
sense to make them all keyable.

Fixed branchChange event: you need a shim event in the
panel class.  So each panel class object listens on
the Item_Manager's branchChange event, and when that
happens, the panel object sends its own branchChange
event. All this just so we can use the event in MXML, 
e.g., branchChange="this.on_branch_change(event)".

Fixed main.mxml load order (I'm not sure why I didn't 
fix this long ago). Hooking the pre_initialize event, 
so we can load the Item_Manager and Panel_Manager and 
other subsystems before Flex hydrates all the MXML 
in main. Also moved some class-level code (ick!) out 
of G.as and into main.on_preinitialize (yea!).

Very Awesome Checkin.

The Shapefile import script runs against the Bikeways data.

If analyzes the features being imported and saves them to 
two places: a new shapefile and to the Cyclopath database.

Many statistics are maintained so that the script can complain 
about illegal or abnormal features. The complaints come at 
the end, so you can run the script and get a copy-and-paste 
list of IDs to paste into ArcMap to fix the problem features 
all at once.

At VERBOSE4 log level, the script completes in ~ 4/5 of an hour.

I've tested up to committing to the database (I've been rolling 
back). Also, I haven't inspected the target shapefile. So there 
will be more fixes once I run the script for real and inspect 
the new Cyclopath revisions and the new shapefile.

Solved the problem with attributes that indicate 
"sides of the street", e.g., "bike lane side", 
which always felt like the wrong way to store this 
information.

E.g., a bike lane is not just on both sides of the 
street or just on one side: it could be on both sides 
of the street but be a different type of bike lane on 
either side.

Same with shoulder width. E.g., the shoulder on one 
side of the road is 5 feet wide and on the other side, 
there is no shoulder.

So I introduced the idea of "directional" attributes. 
An attribute that is marked directional either applies 
once -- equally -- to both "sides" of a street, or it 
applies twice -- two distinct link_values -- to either 
direction of the street.

Highlight!: Save new and update link_values!

E.g., change speed limit on a street. (I know, 
it doesn't sound like much, but saving links 
is complicated business! =)

Also: Speed up map load by lazy-loading 
attribute link_values. (Loading attribute 
link_values using a PostGIS geometry query 
using the client viewport takes 10 to 20 
seconds.)

Bugfixes:

* Not setting/remembering public branch ID in 
  client for use when saving items and making 
  the group_item_access records.

* Pyserver link_value save was not calculating 
  name but accepting flashclient's name. And 
  Flashclient should not be setting name, anyway.

* Flashclient was sending values for the link_value
  value_* columns that were not set. And pyserver 
  was seeing 'nan' and 'null' and getting confused.

* Cleaned up Flashclient commit. changedset is now 
  just a Set, not a Set2

* Fixed problem sending similar, multiple, overlapped 
  out-of-band requests: the client was flagging second 
  and subsequent requests as copies of the first, even 
  though each request was unique.

* Added client GUI controls for attributes whose values 
  are boolean or string values (was only supporting 
  integer values up 'til now).

* Flashclient now gets one_way from geofeature, rather
  than from attribute link_value (z-level and one_way 
  had been set using attribute link_value, but they make 
  more sense as members of geofeature).

* Item_Type.as is dynamic, but the compiler flag 'static' 
  is enabled, so the silly lookup table hasn't been that 
  useful. So I made all the item types attributes of 
  the Item_Type class, for easy usage.

* Fixed lots of issues detecting changes to attributes and 
  updating the GUI panels in flashclient.

* Lots and tons of lots of lots of fixes to pyserver's 
  grac_manager: fixes bugs saving new and existing link_values.
  Also fixed new_item_policy when applied to links (bugs trying 
  to figure out the types of the left and right linked items).

* Many fixes to MapServer.

  * Fixed layering, so byways are drawn according to their z-level. 
    This is tricky to do in MapServer because of how STYLEs are 
    defined (they should be predefined, but they can't be and must 
    be defined at render-time, but they only can be configured once, 
    so you can't change a STYLE once it's defined, but since STYLEs 
    are defined in the render code, you have to be tricky about how 
    they're defined). See the code for lots of comments about this 
    gotcha/caveat.

  * Fixed coloring and STYLE definitions, so that all of the draw 
    config is stored in the database, such that it can be used by 
    MapServer, Flashclient, and Android. (Up until now, because of 
    the trickiness with MapServer STYLEs, colors and whatnot were 
    hard-coded in the MapServer config, as well as being stored in 
    the database; now, the config is solely stored in the database.)

  * Beefed up labeling so we can configure more of the options 
    available in MapServer, like outlining text, changing font 
    faces, changing font size, etc.

  * Combined the shadows layer into the byways layer. Since MapServer 
    draws one layer and then another, the shadow layer didn't quite 
    work as intended: some byways would hide the shadows of other 
    byways, so shadowing appeared inconsistent.

  * Moved tilecache_update.py from pyserver/ to mapserver/, so that 
    it's alongside its brethren.

    * Added a handful more configurable visual styles to the skins, 
      and created a special zoom to get around the STYLE problem 
      described above -- we take our skins lookup table, which has one 
      row of style values for each unique (geofeature type, zoom level), 
      and we make a flat table view which just has rows for each unique 
      zoom level, such that all the style values for all the geofeature 
      types are made into their own columns. This is not elegant, and 
      it's not endlessly scalable: Postgres only supports around 1,500 
      columns in any given table.

* Making MapServer/TileCache and Flashclient "skinnable". See 
  mapserver/skins/skin_bikeways.py for the draw config for the 
  new bikeways map style. You can make a copy of that file and 
  edit it to make new "skins".
  
  * We need a drop-down in flashclient so the user to select 
    which skin they want to use.

* Added a README with comments regarding MapServer (since MapServer 
  is a very peculiar and picky piece of software).

* Added new serif fonts to MapServer (Liberation Sans, basically 
  the free version of Arial used by OpenOffice).

  * Moved fonts to a fonts/ subfolder to de-clutter mapserver/.

* Added the "extended skin config" to flashclient -- it requests 
  it on startup, so flashclient now has the draw config created 
  and used by tilecache_update.py to make the new tiles.

* Overhauled tilecache_update.py.

  - It was using the old database schema; not it uses the new one.

  - The script takes one or more group IDs and one or more branch 
    IDs to use when fetching items from the database. This means, 
    e.g., we could create unique sets of tiles for each branch. 
    For now, we'll use this feature to create tiles and use the 
    metc bikeways data to draw bike lanes, etc.

  - Updates to *.map files to use new cache table.

  - Doubled the script size, from 425 lines to 950 lines....

* Combined some common functionality in link_attribute and link_post, 
  which both sometimes fetch attribute definitions, into a new 
  intermediate class, link_uses_attr.

* Found a BUGBUG in MapServer: it parses SQL line-by-line rather 
  than properly tokenizing, so your *.map files should be careful 
  with their SQL and not split certain lines. E.g., the "FROM" 
  keyword must be on the same line as the table name "FROM my_table"
  works, but "FROM \n my_table" does not work!

* Increased flashclient GWIS timeout to 10 minutes, to help 
  with development until we fix the leafy branch link_value 
  checkout problem (it's really slow!)

Metc Bikeways Import bugfix: Skip calculating geometry for revision with tens of thousands of link_value attribute changes: PostGIS keeps assert()ing and crashing Postgres; not important data, anyway (changes affect so many byways that the revision geosummary is basically the whole map).

* Side-tracked by a PostGIS bug that occurs while creating 
  revision geometries during the metc bikeways import:

   There's a bug in PostGIS (at least I [lb] assume it's a bug):

     http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/473
       "RightmostEdgeFinder assertion killing postgres process"

   This happens if you try to ST_Buffer() too many geometries -- 
   I couldn't find a hard-and-fast number of geometries because it varies 
   on the query, but, on my laptop, it generally happens when processing 
   500 to 1000 geometries or more. The error occurs in both PostGIS
   v1.3.6/Geos v3.2.0 and PostGIS v.1.5.3/Geos v3.3.0, and reads:

    SELECT: RightmostEdgeFinder.cpp:77: 
      void geos::operation::buffer::RightmostEdgeFinder::findEdge(
        std::vector<geos::geomgraph::DirectedEdge*>*): 
        Assertion `checked>0' failed.

   After lots of fiddling, it turns out you can circumvent the error if
   you simplify a polygonized collection of the geometry. I assume the
   problem is resource-related and that simplifing the geometry collection
   just avoids the problem. As for polygonizing, that converts the 
   MULTILINESTRING to a MULTIPOLYGON (otherwise the simplify just returns 
   a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION which triggers a table constrainst complaint).

* Upgrade PostGIS 1.3 -> PostGIS 1.5

  - Also Geos 3.2 -> Geos 3.3

* Some tweaks to the mapserver config. Just the start...

  - Make highways less prominent.

  - Make bike trails more obvious.

    - collecting geometry and geosummary information for

      byways, so added geometry for unchanged byways whose

* Moved client_id_map from static member of item_versioned.One

  between sessions (albeit not predictably -- I think it must

* Cleaned up some of the link_value-derived class' SQL

* Fixed the link_value problem noted in the last checkin:
  pyserver was ignoring the bbox filter, so it was returning 
  _all_ link_values, which took a long time and produced a 
  huge GWIS packet, and flashclient either timedout while

Lots of Big Problems Solved[1] in pyserver.

^ Fixed Link_Value Fetching to Use Branch Hierarchy and 
Honor Permissions of the Items Being Linked.

^ Implemented Diffing.

^ New New Item Policy to Control Inherited Permissions.

^ Major Overhaul of Revision Class; Inclusion of Group Ids.

===========================================================

+ Because of branching and permissions, diffing no longer 
works the way it used to. 

In Ccpv1, the client would send three requests -- a.) one
for old items, b.) one for new, and c.) one for static --
and the server could just search a.) for items in both
revisions, b.) for items that only existed in the old
revision (their new version having been marked deleted),
and c.) for items that only exist in the new revision (the
item having been created since the old revision).

In Ccpv2, however, a 'new' item might appear new because 
the user does not have permissions to see the old item. 
Also, you cannot perform one search to find 'static' items -- 
the records in group_item_access represent subsets of
items' valid_start_rid and valid_until_rid values, so we
cannot use a fetched group_item_access record to figure out
if the item in question is 'new', 'old', or 'static'. 

Specifically, our query only tells us the access the user 
has to an item at a specific revision, so we have to use 
at least two queries when Diffing.

+ Because of branching and permissions, viewport fetching
is Very Tricky.

In Ccpv1, if you searched a viewport, you'd find all
the items within that viewport. There were basically
two types of items being fetched, geofeatures and
link_values. Attachments were also fetched, by only by way
of link_values. This approach works well in Ccpv1, because
there are no branches and every thing is public.

However, a few big problems affect this approach in Ccpv2.

* For one, viewport queries will find false-positives.

For example, consider a byway in the basemap that's in my
viewport. Now assume that in my branch, I drag the byway
outside the viewport. When you search for byways in that
viewport, you'll find the basemap item and not the item in
the branch.

To solve this, after fetching items based on the viewport,
pyserver has to inspect every item one by one and see if a
"leafier" item exists.

In the previous example, pyserver would find the basemap
item, see that it's branch ID is not the same as the
working branch, and so pyserver would query the item ID and
see if an item with the same ID is saved to a branch that 
descends from the basemap.

* The second big problem is permissions false-positives.

This is basically the same as the last problem, except this
happens when permissions change on an item, and so the
query finds an item in a parent branch and skips leafier
items to which the user does not have access.

The solution is similar to the earlier one: look for a
leafier item. If one is found and the user does not have
permissions to see it, ignore it (actually, rather than
searching a second time, pyserver does a more permissive
initial search that includes all items, and it filters on
access permissions when processing the results of the 
query).

* The third problem is how to get geometry for links.

We cannot just join link_value against geofeature, because
we have to check user permissions and make sure we get the
leafieast item, too.

So we join twice against the group_item_access table (once
for the attachment, and again for the geofeature), and then
we check the group IDs of the linked items to make sure
they match the user's group IDs, and then we check the
branch IDs of the linked items to make sure they match the
branch hierarchy.

The real trick is how to sort through all the mess, since
we've joined group_item_access against itself three times,
so we could end up with lots of rows for the same items,
some from different branches or with different access
levels. Fortunately, if you sort your results smartly and
run DISTINCT ON, you can select the "best match", that is,
the link value linked to the leafiest items with the best
access permissions.

* The third problem is how to actually Diff. Things are a 
lot more complicated than they used to be.

In Ccpv2, rather than have the client send three queries
like in Ccpv1, the client just sends one Diff query and the
server processes everything at once. It starts by fetching
all the items in both the old and the new revisions,
resolving leafiness as appropriate in each. Then, it goes
through the items and matches up stack IDs. If two stack
IDs match and their system IDs also match, then the item is
considered 'static' (not changed between revisions). If the
system IDs do not match, then one item is the 'former' item
and the other is the 'latter' item (hint: In Ccpv1, these
were 'old' and 'new'). Lastly, if one item was not found
and we're searching by viewport, we have to look up the
stack ID of the other ("counterpart") item. Kind of like
the reasons discussed above when searching by viewport, but
in this case, rather than ignore the item, we still want
to send it to the client -- e.g., if a geofeature is moved
outside the viewport, we still want to send it, so the
client can show the diff.

I also added a grac_hash variable, but it's not wholly 
implemented. The idea is to create a hash value of all 
of a user's group_item_access records for an item at a 
particular revision so that, even if a Diff item is 
considered 'static', we could indicate to the user if 
maybe their permissions changed. (Like I said, though, 
this is not completely implemented -- we need to write 
an SQL aggregate fcn. to calculate the grac_hash by 
bitwise XORing some of group_item_access's columns, 
like group_id, item_id, and access_level_id.)

===========================================================

+ Some other changes:

* When processing a request, pyserver gets the user's group
IDs at one or both revision IDs being requested.

* Made a handful of private variables in Item_Query_Builder
to better help build the SQL query. This includes sticking
use_filters_and_viewport and use_limit_and_offset in the
object, as well as a new diff_group value to help with
processing Diffs. I also added force_rev_gids, to control
if the SQL checks group_memberships by joining tables, or
if it does a WHERE IN () query. Also, leaf_gf_stack_id and
leaf_gf_branch_id are used when resolving leafiness issues,
as described above.

* Hydrated grac/group_item_access.py with all the columns 
in the schema that were not defined in the Python class 
but were present in the schema.

* Moved access_scope_id from item_user_access to
group_item_access. The value cannot be accurately
calculated in group_item_access when bulk-fetching items,
and it's only displayed on the Groups tab in flashclient,
so the value is now lazy-loaded and calculated on demand,
one item at a time. See grac.group_item_access.py.

* Cleaned up some grac/*.py SQL, especially in group_membership.

* Removed 'geometry' column from group_item_access. Besides 
being redundant, it's impossible to populate this value 
correctly for link_values, since the linked geofeature
could come from any branch or have any permissions. So the
geometry has to be linked in during the query so we can
verify permissions and make sure we get the item from the
correct branch.

* Made revision intermediate base class, Revision_Base, and
put all the @staticmethods in the base class, Revision.
Since the other classes -- Current, Historic, Diff, and
Updated -- all derive from the same class, splitting out
the staticmethods makes this class more readable.

* Got rid of Revision.as_sql_where_or, which never
solved the problem I had with Diff. Added some parms to
as_sql_where and added as_sql_where_strict, which is used
on any Revision object to check permissions one an item at
a given revision.

* Renamed some short-name GWIS values used by revision_get.
@u -> is_revert, @fb -> feedback_exists, and @ts -> timestamp.

* Cleaned up and fixed issues in group_revision not quite 
representing reality correctly.

* Lots and lots of changes to pyserver/item/item_user_access.py

===========================================================

[1]WARNING: This code isn't completed debugged. I've       
sucessfully ran it against ccp.py... well, specifically,   
  $ ./ccp.py -U landonb -r -t branch
The code needs to be debugged and will have errors. But I'm
going on vacation and want to get it checked in, and, well,
the ccpv2 "trunk" is really just a working branch, anyway,
until it's released, so this bothers me only a little. If
this code were being actively developed by others, or
if there was a cronjob somewhere checking this code out
and installing it on a nightly basis, then maybe I'd
care. But this is a lot of cool new code that apparently
solves Diffing and respeking branches and permissions on
link_values, so I couldn't be happier to check it in.

Ccpv2 Schema Changes

* Added access_existing to new_item_policy

So when you give the public access to your branch, 
you can control what __existing__ items they can 
edit (where existing mostly means items inherited 
from the parent branch, to which the public has 
edit access to -- so you can restrict their access 
to viewer, for example).

* Removed geometry and z from group_item_access

(1) I'm not sure the performance gain is significant 
(as opposed to just joining the geofeature table).

(2) There's not a reliable way to calculate the 
geometry for links, so the purpose of storing 
geometry in group_item_access can not be fulfilled.
That is, we wanted an easy to find links for items 
in a specific viewport: but we also need to check 
the user's access levels to the two items being 
linked (the LHS and RHS items), so, while a user 
may have editor access rights to a link, they 
may be denied access to the geofeature, and 
therefore, the link should not indicate the geometry, 
since the user technically cannot see the geofeature.

* Removed revision geometry functions (cp_revision_* et al)

These are better suited as pyserver functions. That 
way, they are easier to maintain, and we can call 
them when we want, since they can be lengthy operations.

* Dropped skip_geometry from revision and group_revision

The value is not used and can be inferred by checking
if revision.geometry IS NULL.

* Some other fixes to ccp.py and Metc bikeways import

Ccp.py support for link_value LHS and RHS types.

Fixed only_stack_ids filter.

Fixed filters in Ccp: was not appending to URL.

* Other fixes

Pyserver: Was not setting group_item_access.name for 
link_values.

Shortened query filter GWIS names.

Added lazy-loading to flashclient for link_values 
when geofeature is selected.

Osgeo bug workaround:

It might be a bad geometry, but they all check out as
ST_IsValid. 

Fortunately, of the three geosummary columns in the
revision and group_revision tables -- geometry, geosummary,
and bbox -- only geosummary and bbox are actually used: so
commenting-out calculation of geometry column.

Metc Bikeways Import Script actually runs\! =) This checkin adds code to split byways and make link_values. I added code to figure out start and end nodes, too, so hopefully the bikeways data will be somewhat connected to the existing Cyclopath byways. The script takes 100 minutes to run (I think) and still needs to be vetted: the last time I ran it, the group_item_access rows for geofeature items were missing their geometry. And there are bound to be a few other issues, too, but things are mostly coming together.

Lots of Bugfixes (regression bugs) for saving items to Ccpv2.

Bug 2522 (production bug from Ccpv1) for fetching
geofeatures.  Geofeature geometries have always been
fetched as SVG, but to save to the database, they need
to be in native or WKT format. This is because, usually,
when you fetch an item from the database, it's to send it
to flashclient.  But with the bikeways import script, we
fetch items that we intend to edit and then save back to
the database: and in Ccpv1, you can't fetch a geofeature
(and hydrate a geofeature.One() object) and then save
it back to the database, because the geometry is in the
wrong format. In Ccpv2, see the new geofeature members,
geometry_svg and geometry_wkt.

Prefixed a bunch of PostGIS fcns. with "ST_", to follow 
our convention of prefixing postgresql functions with 
common prefixes to figure out which libraries the 
functions are from.

Script to create new item policies 
for a group for that group's branch.
Policies are similar to those for the 
basemap, but only for the grorp: so if 
you give the public editor access, they 
won't actually be able to edit anything 
(though they'll be able to view everything,
the same as if you gave the public viewer 
access to the branch).

  E.g.,

Reworked the rev_spec package hierarchy to match reality
a bit better. I was running into some issues switching
between branches and logging in and logging out, and this
helped with the problem.

   The revision classes hierarchy is split into two groups:
   one group for editable items, and one group for historic
   items. The former group is called 'follow', as in, the
   items follow the latest items on the server. The latter
   is called 'pinned', since the items are checked out just
   once and are not editable.

      Base
      | 
      | - Follow
      | | 
      | | - Current
      | | |
      | | | - Changed
      | | 
      | | - Working
      | 
      | - Pinned
      | |
      | | - Diff
      | | 
      | | - Historic

   In G.map, there's now rev_working and rev_canvas. The
   latter, rev_canvas, always reflects the state of the map
   (set to either follow or pinned; if follow, set to same
   object as rev_working.) The former, rev_working, just
   tracks the follow state: it begins life as Current and
   then cycles between Working and Changed.

Aliased Introspect.get_constructor to Introspect.ctor.

Fixed some bugs switching between branches and users in

r25232 | landonb | 2011-08-22 23:18:38 -0500 (Mon, 22 Aug 2011) | 22 lines


Refactored SQL query

* Old inner query got items and figured out the 
  (valid_start_rid, valid_until_rid) ranges, and 
  the outer query coalesced these results.
* But, really: we're only selecting items from one 
  specific revision, so the range is meaningless.
* Also: we can order-by and select-distinct-on to 
  replace aggregate fcns. we used to use (that is, 
  min(access_level_id); we need the distinct-on to 
  figure out stacked branching, so this is a winwin.

Bugfix: get leafiest-branch item

* When you checkout items for a particular viewport (bbox),
  you have to double-check every item for a leafier item,
  since, in a newer branch, an item in the viewport in an
  older branch may have beed moved in a newer branch, so
  the newer branch is not found in the query.

* Replaced optparse with argparse.

Fix to access_level_id default from ccp.py:
requires that shared_secret be used (since 
item_user_access wants to default to 
Access_Level.client and needs to trust change 
is ok).

Some whitespace/comments changes.

Silly/Embarrassing revision bugfix: was always 
setting allow_deleted to False.

Item_Query_Builder:

* Mirror request_is_secret

* New 'enabled', since outer select will no 
  longer be required (coming in next checkin)

  -c -t group \
  -m "Make Group: Metc Bikeways 2011" \
  -e name "Metc Bikeways 2011" \

  if it has to run route.One.nodeid_from_xy() to find 
  the nearest Cyclopath node for each transit node; I 
  added a cache table to store nearest nodes, and now

Tons of bugfixes to route finding. Can start routed_ver=v1 now, and it returns routes, and they draw on the map. Panel needs to be debugged.

==========

Fixed a bunch of problems in the search SQL.

ccp.py should now returns results! e.g.,

  py ccp.py -s -q "longfellow"

* Rewrote python to group connected byways. In V1, pyserver went 
  through byway results in a nested loop fashion to compare and 
  locate connect byways. Now, the byway results are iterated over 
  just once, but a bunch of lookups are used to figure out 
  connectedness, so I'm not sure if there's a big performance 
  difference. There was no choice but to rewrite the code, since 
  full text search changed how the results are returned. See 
  process_results_byways.

* Changed the include and exclude match information that's 
  returned to flaseclient. In V1, there were six match types -- 
  three sub types each for include and exclude; the three sub 
  types were names, tags, and comments. Included in the XML 
  returned to flashclient was an XML document for each query 
  term, for each result -- which is a lot of extra documents!
  flashclient only cares if there's a match for each of the sub 
  types, and it doesn't care about the terms that matched, so, 
  in V2, the return documents are not included. Instead, each 
  result indicates which of the match types had a hit or not.
  Also, in V1, the six match types were hard-coded in the class. 
  In V2, there are two include and exclude aggregates hard-coded 
  in the class, but they support a variable number of sub types,
  so it should be easy to add new ones.

* Moved Full_Text_Query class and its ilk to new file, so they 
  can be used by both search_map and search_result.

* NOTE: Still need to update flashclient to recognize new XML
        format.

==========

* Major overhaul of the pyserver search functionality:

  ** address.py reduced to mostly a shell class.

  ** New class link_tag to help find geofeatures by
     linked-attachment criteria.

  ** New class geocode_address to de-couple code common 
     to address.py and geocode.py (otherwise we get 
     infinite import loop problem).

  ** geocode.py: moved addr_geocode to geocode_address.py 
     and class-ified geocode.py (made new Geocode class).

  ** Major overhaul of search_map.py: using Postgres 8.3 
     full text search, rather than the homegrown search 
     built into V1 (which assumes Postgres 8.2, which does 
     not support full text search).

* Updated ccp.py to test search.

  ** Try, e.g., py ccp.py -s -q "hennepin"

  *** (Search 'works' but is still broken: no rows returned.
       So the SQL is wrong, but at least the python 'works'.)

* Added search params to query_filter: query, centerx, and centery.

* Trying 'street' instead of 'byway' or 'block' or 'road'.

* Added two new Item_Types: track and track_point.

* Propragate from V2 update scripts to pyserver and flashclient:
rename owner_name to created_by, in honor of group access control.

I was going to work on Discussions today, but for post_revision 
link_values to work, the Revision_Get command needed work. So I 
worked on that GWIS command instead.

* Implemented Group_Revision classes in pyserver and flashclient, 
  for fetching and processing group_revision records.

* Revamped pyserver/gwis/command_/revision_get.py to use new SQL 
  schema.

* The code is debugged, but it still doesn't work: the revision_get 
  command is returning 0 rows, but we're on the right path...

==========

* Implemented Out-Of-Band request handling in flashclient's
  Update Manager.

** Not completely implemented. GWIS_Handshake works.
   GWIS_Checkout_Discussions needs to be debugged. I haven't
   converted any other GWIS_* commands.

* Completely re-tooled the Update_Manager_* and GWIS_Update_* 
  classes in flashclient/views/update

** Got rid of the Update_Manager_* classes, which were just 
   silly wrappers around the GWIS_Update_* classes.

** Moved views/update to gwis/update, and 
   moved views/Update_Manager.as to gwis/.

** Any GWIS_* command can be fed to Update_Manager so it can 
   be managed intelligently.  That is, if user does something 
   that invalidates other commands, we can cancel the other
   commands, wait for them to complete, or whatever.

* All usages of consensus now use the consensus_f algorithm, 
  which accepts any container, not just an Array.

* Changed spelling: 'cancelled' to 'canceled', to be more 
  consistent. A search engine has 50M hits for 'canceled'
  and 200M for 'calcelled', but canceled is the proper 
  American English spelling. Cancelled is used in all other 
  English speaking countries, according to
   https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28spelling%29

* Removed Mikhil's Better Ccp By Spring (a/k/a compliance)
  code.

==========

Generalized search filters from Discussions.

- Made a Query_Filters objects in both pyserver and
  flashclient. Use this to specify SQL WHERE-clause-ish
  things, like search strings, region constraints, etc., 
  and to specify LIMIT and OFFSET for pageination.

- Appy Query_Filters to Search, Discussions, and regular
  Checkout commands (in fact, Checkout is the new base 
  class for Search and Discussions commands).

- NOTE: Discussions would filter results by sendings 
  a new network request as the user selected different 
  filter options.
  -- But Search filters results solely in the client, 
     issuing only one network request and then filtering 
     what's displayed to the user.

- FIXME: Query_Filters is not completely implemented in 
         flashclient.

- Discussions: Changed names of filters to be consistent 
               and unique.

- Flashclient: Fixed Grid-height issue w/ Tab_Branch_Attrs.

- Flashclient: Fixed missing item type dropdown on Tab Geof 
               Adv.

- Pyserver: Fixed link_value checkout (wasn't honoring link 
            type IDs, so was fetching all links for eacy 
            query). Fix should make flashclient load a little 
            quicker.

- Pyserver: Implemented threads and posts. (Until flashclient 
            Discussions works, you can use Ccp.py script to 
            checkout threads and posts.)

- Pyserver: Updated winpdb to 1.4.8. (supports Pythin 2.7).

SQL Schema changes:

* Added one_way column to geofeature: I think it's too
costly to fetch as an arbitrary attribute, since it's
needed by the client to draw the map. Also, geofeature
already has a few byway-specific attributes, like start_
and end_node_id.

* Added two aggregate functions, FIRST() and LAST(). (These
are common SQL fcns. that just happen not to be standard.)

* Dropping all Discussions SQL fcns. (1) These are broken 
because of user permissions; and (2) These were sometimes 
used poorly (as inline SELECTs that always returned the same 
value), which would cause Postgres to have to evaluate every 
row, such that it was unable to optimize the transaction.

Major changes to the panel infrastructure

- Renamed Side_Panel.as to Panel_Manager.as.

- Changed all the fcns. from static class members to 
  instance methods and made G.app.panel_mgr instance.
  (I'm trying to get away from static attributes and 
   methods, which aren't as flexible as instance 
   attributes and methods). It also helps debugging 
   and developing.

  - One benefit: Side_Panel.as was all static functions, 
    and all the fcns. had to refer to attributes 
    with the qualified class name, e.g., "Side_Panel.my_attr".
    By removing the static-ness, we can go back to normal 
    coding conventions and just reference the instance, 
    e.g., "this.my_attr".

- New items-panel navigation.

  - You can select items on the map and then view the 
    branch details without having your items be deseleted.

  - The active side panel is no longer directly tied to what's 
    selected. E.g., in V1, if active_attachment is set, the 
    attachment panel is always displayed (and the same goes 
    for the active thread, active route, etc.). Now, what's 
    selected in the map and the panel that's showing are 
    independent.

    - This lets the user, for example, select some items on 
      the map, then go to the branch panel, create a new 
      attribute, and then apply it to the selected map items.

- Bugfix: if some GWIS data is received before the tags are 
  received, the map never completes loading.

  - The problem was, when I wanted to call update_nudge, 
    I was accidentally looking for a GWIS_Update_Viewport_Items 
    instance when I really wanted to look for a 
    Update_Manager_Viewport_Items instance.

- Added the idea of a 'dirty' panel, so we can specify 
  when data is dirty, and when the user's access levels 
  have changed. This helps us avoid calling on_show 
  for each panel (even those that are hidden) in 
  response to the user messing around on the map.
  It also means we update controls when data is dirty, 
  but we enable/disable controls when the user's 
  access changes.

- Got rid of 'details_current', which was an unnecessary 
  abstraction. In V1, it's a Dictionary of panels, and 
  it's keyed by a String. But we already have collections 
  of panels, so this was an extra layer that just made 
  things more complex without actually solving anything.
  So now, the code just grabs the side_panel container 
  to figure out which panel is active, and we don't 
  need an extra lookup.

Renamed G.fcookies to G.fcookies_user to complement 
the already-named G.fcookies_anon.

GUI label name changes per Cycloplan useability testing.
E.g., "Routes" renamed "Find a Bike Route". None of these 
are finalized; we need to discuss as a team first, as I'd 
like team consensus on each of the name changes.

Moved G.map.active_attachment to G.item_mgr.active_attachment, 
along with active_thread and active_post. Also moved 
Branch.active_branch to G.item_mgr.

Cleaned up places in the panel and command classes where a Set() 
was converted to an Array via as_Array() and then later converted
back to a set via new Set(my_array). The classes should instead 
use a reference to the original Set whenever possible, and they 
should only create a copy when needed (i.e., when the user 
executes a command, set.clone() is called).

- Also changed places in Discussions code where Set() was converted 
  to Array() just for purposes of iteration -- because Set() is 
  already iterable, there's no need to convert to an Array.

The panel class now uses get_selected_items() to gets its 
selectionset, rather than just always using G.map.selected.
This lets a branch, for instance, use the tags widget.

- This also means we can clean up cases where the selected 
  set is only ever 0 or 1 items in length. In the code, 
  you'd find items_selected[0] a lot; it wasn't always 
  clear to me why we only got the first element, but it's 
  because the collection was only ever at most 1 in length.
  Also, since we don't convert Set()s to Array()s (see 
  earlier comment), indexing [0] won't work. To solve the 
  latter issue, and to make things more clear -- that is, 
  that sometimes items_selected is only ever a collection of 
  at most 1 item -- I added one() to Set(), which ensures the 
  Set has only 0 or 1 items, and returns the 1 item if it exists.
  
- I also added Set().every() to replace calls to Array().every().

Added code to resize the Attribute details panel contents -- it's
a Grid, and Grids don't know how to size themselves (they always 
display everything, even if it clips beneath other containers).

Added prelim. code to 'lock' new attribute definition once it's
used (e.g., users should not be able to change an Integer-type 
attribute to String-type).

==========

Navigation improvements:

- Branch and Selected Items also show, above panel title.

- Right now this is just stubbed, but intent is:

  - Click on Branch or Selected Items to go to Item Details 
    panel for the branch or selected items.

  - You can edit the Branch (e.g., add attributes) without 
    needing to de-select selected map items.

- Moved and renamed some files in flashclient/views/widgets
  to flashclient/views/panels (these files represent panels, 
  not widgets, so they were in the wrong package).

- Renamed the modules in flashclient/views/panels, prefixing 
  panel modules with Panel_*.

  - Also, (most) panels now derive from Detail_Panel_Base 
    (two of the panels are not updated yet).

- Removed old code for empty panel, since there is no more 
  empty panel.

- Lots of cleanup to Side_Panel.as, some to main.mxml.

- Stacked branching: fixed pyserver's tag_counts SQL.

- Changed public map names from "Public Map" to "Mpls-St. Paul"
  and "Denver-Boulder".

Some changes from last Thursday and Friday in St. Paul, 
between usability testing with human subjects.

- Partial Bugfix: Cannot switch branches from client.

- Bugfix: Flex NumericStepper has issues with large numbers.
          Introduced a min and a max value, which I trial-and-
          errored to figure out.

- Bugfix: In flashclient, the steppers for new attributes 
          are exceedingly wide, causing the side panel 
          to show a horizontal scroll bar.

- Bugfix: Errant 'S' after search icon in TabBar.

- Bugfix: branch_hier_build set same stack id for each branch 
          in hier.

- Lots and lots of cleanup to the SQL schema.

  - Prefixing Cyclopath fcns with "cp_", just like PostGIS 
    prefixes its fcns. Makes it easier to tell whose fcn. is 
    whose when you execute '\df' in psql.

  - Delete unused fcns. Re-implement others to use V2 schema.

  - Update developer permissions script.

Bugfixes for unit testing tomorrow, er, later this morning.

- Access_Scope.as IDs were flip-flopped, that is, public was 1 instead
  of 3 and private was 3 instead of 1. Shared was always 2.

- Moved alert-unsaved to own fcn. so it can be called when user wants 
  to change branches.

- Branch list in flashclient disable buttons until branches are selected 
  in the list. The active branch's label is italicized and appeded with 
  " (Active)".

- Fixed attribute value_type dropdown, which has wrong id for 'integer'.

- Exchanged assert for a logfile warning in the double-click detector, 
  which sometimes fire on_mouse_down even though it appears the double-
  click handler wasn't started. Maybe this has to do with clicking in 
  the panel and then quickly clicking in the map??

- Fixed bug with attribute list not being hidden for item types that 
  have no attributes defined.

- Fixed bug clicking 'edit' attribute, then navigating back to branch 
  panel, and then clicking 'edit' attribute again. The attribute panel 
  was not being rendered correctly the second time, because it didn't 
  think an attachment was selected.

- Only show branch conflicts tab if there are branch conflicts.

- Made new class for common pagination code. This class is still alpha....

- Fixed error with on_initialize() not always being called for Tab_Panel_*
  instances.

==========

New Access Level: stealth (less than client but more than denied).

- Items with stealth access are not discoverable (like a route 
  whose link you shared with your friends). This is different from 
  items with client access, which are discoverable, but not really 
  viewable (like attribute definitions: flashclient knows about 
  them, but the user doesn't really).

==========

Bugfixes: Show branch list.

- SQL had "AND branch_id = %d" which doesn't make sense when you're 
  trying to compile a list of branches.

Bugfix: Check user's group_membership access_level_id when fetching items!

Show branches in maps list:

- made base class from GWIS_Region_Names_Get.as (GWIS_Item_Names_Get.as) 
  and made new GWIS_Branch_Names_Get.as.

- in pyserver, renamed region_names_get.py to item_names_get.py and made 
  generic, so you can get names and stack_ids of any item type.

- get branch list in same context as user, i.e., GWIS_Update_User.

==========

Additional debug statments and asserts to help debug 
item saving and branches and group permissions.

- Added logging facility to pyserver like that which is 
  in flashclient.

- Added item.__str_abbrev__ to print fewer details about
  items.

- Some additional checks in branch.py when saving items.

Cannot simply, 
    if xml_doc: 
  you need to 
    if xml_doc is not None:
  Interesting.

Added concept of local-request to pyserver, so that ccp.py 
can exercise new commands not supported by flashclient, and 
we don't have to worry about someone 'hacking' cyclopath by 
sending these new commands.

Various bugfixes.

- Incl., branch must set branch_id to stack_id. Though not 
  used, the item_versioned class infrastructure expects it.

- Checkout cmd: Only confirm_leafiness if viewport not None.

- Mucked with the [logging] and [debugging] sections in CONFIG.

- Updates to ccp.py for creating branches.

Branch 'Extra' tab

  - Next to each attribute in the list, hid '+' and '-', and removed 'x'. We 
    will not implement the attribute gui sort order now (the + and - buttons)
    and we will not allow deleting attributes from the manage attributes widget
    (the user should click 'edit' and then find the 'delete attribute' button).

  - Fixed: Item Type dropdown was hidden but still taking up space in GUI. 
           I moved includeInLayout to parent/enclosing container.

==========

- Fixed bug in pyserver/item/util/item_factory.py

  - Raise error on module not found, don't just return None.

==========

- Fixed bugs in mapserver / tilecache_update:

  - Wrong table referenced for column in *.map files.

  - V1->V2 upgrade scripts accidentally deleted 'tiles_cache_byway' 
    PostGIS's geometry_columns (the scripts deleted any table in 
    geometry_columns that it didn't find in the current schema, and 
    I forgot to update geometry_columns when I renamed tiles_cache_byway
    from byway_name_cache).

==========

- Fixed bug: Race condition btw. Group Membership and New 
             Item Policy GWIS commands somtimes caused 
             assertion on startup.

  - Made a new update class to get branchy stuff (regions names, 
    tag names, and user group memberships) after getting branch 
    ID but before getting attachments, geofeatures, and link_values.
    See views/update/GWIS_Update_User and Update_Manager_User.

  - Fixed GWIS_Region_Names_Get, which wasn't sending branch ID.

==========

- Fixed bug: User always prompted to save on browser close 
             even if nothing dirty.

  - Reworked: G.map.is_dirty_public/private.

    - These fcns. are used to prompt the user when saving or when 
      they navigate away from a dirty map. When saving, the old 
      rule of "is-public" no longer applies, since the client can 
      never know the true visibility of an item (since the user 
      only sees groups of which s/he is a member, the user may  
      not know if other groups also have access to the item).

    - Item now maintains a set of dirty group_item_access objects, 
      rather than storing them in the map's dirtyset.

- If dirtyset only includes ratings, watchers, and read 
  events, the user is not prompted for a changenote. If the 
  dirtyset include items or group access changes, the 
  user is prompted for a changenote.

- Flashclient only saves to the server group item accesses that 
  have changed. Before, it sent them all.

==========

- On Item Details 'Extra' tab

  - Hide Geofeature Layer type dropdown for geofeatures 
    whose only layer is 'default'

    - Added 'restrict_usage' column to geofeature_layer 
      table.

    - Updated SQL scripts and pyserver.

  - Hide Edit Attributes box for geofeature types that do not 
    have any attributes that apply to them.

==========

- New classes, Access_Scope and Dirty_Reason.

  - Dirty_Reason replaces a bunch of loose strings that 
    were passed around the code. By using a class, we can 
    document all of the possible 'reasons' (rather than 
    searching the code and getting a vague idea), and we 
    can more easily search the code for usages of reasons.

  - Added two new reasons for group item access.

==========

- Fixed tilecache_update, which was referencing wrong column name.

I was able to save a waypoint!

I haven't tested other item types.

And the waypoint was saved with two group_item_access rows, 
one for landonb and one for the public group, and both had 
access_level_ids of 1 (owner), so obviously things aren't 
perfect, but at least the python code and SQL are working!

Other significant changes include:

* I fiddled somewhat with route.py, but it still needs to be 
  worked on from top to bottom.

* Lots of changes to routed and tgraph. I worked on these files 
  from top to bottom, upgrading function calls and SQL to V2. 
  They need to be debugged and tested still.

* I fiddled somewhat with route.py, but it still needs to be 
  worked on from top to bottom. It's a long file, though...

* Grac_Error, rather than being a simple enum class, not holds 
  information about the error, so that the commit command can 
  compile a list of errors and return them to the client.

* New link_attribute class represents link_values for a given 
  attribute, like one_way or item_watcher. This is used by the 
  item class to maintain a list of item watchers, and it's 
  used by tgraph to find all the one_ways in a branch at a 
  particular revision.

* Reorganized the derived functions in the item class source 
  files to be consistently placed, that is, located in the same 
  relative places in the files.

* Extensive work on commit.py, grac_manager.py, and the item 
  classes' save routines. Also worked on the mark_deleted 
  routine and added a 'validizer' routine to prep items 
  for saving.

* After an item saves itself, it saves things associated 
  with it that might also be dirty, like group access 
  records for the item.

Fixes to routed and route analytics.

* I worked on routed and tgraph from top to bottom, so they 
  should both be coded, but neither one has not been tested 
  or debugged.

* I changed a few things in route analytics, to make it more 
  versatile.

** Rather than wait 300 seconds after starting routed -- and 
   then just assuming that it started! -- I added code to test 
   when routed is ready. The route analytics script now sits in 
   a while True loop, sleeping for one second between iterations, 
   and tries to open a connection and send routed the new 'hello' 
   command.

** After the 'hello' command, route analytics sends the branch ID 
   and revision ID that it wants loaded. routed loads the graph 
   (which could take a while), and sends an OK packet when finished.
   When it gets the OK, route analytics starts running the route- 
   finding operations.

* Both routed and route analytics read like really long scripts:
  hundreds of lines of code that is in the script body (i.e., 
  not in a function), so I starting making functions and classes 
  as appropriate.

* routed now recognizes delay_load argument, which tells it not 
  to load the network graph until it's told what the revision 
  and branch are.

SQL V2 upgrade scripts:

* Added enum_definition table, since everytime we 
add an enum, we end up adding a table. This new 
table can consume all the other tables (like 
access_scope, access_level, etc.).

* Added attributes for tables that can be turned 
into attributes, like item watchers, byway 
rating, aadt, tag preference, etc.

Some minor changes and new comments to flashclient.

** I can save a waypoint and get an error back from pyserver,

* Lots of fixes and additions to grax/grac_manager.

* item/util/revision.py's revision_save now saves group_revision rows.

* Added more commit errors to Grac_Error.

* query_branch.py wasn't setting self.branch_hier initially.

* Added dirty, fresh, and valid attributes to item_base.

* On commit, item_user_access loads the item's groups_accesses.

* Now tracking client_id in item_versioned so we can give the client 
  a list of errors and working copy IDs.

Stacked-branching fixes in pyserver

- New class Item_Query_Builder bundles a bunch 
  of common parameters that get passed around:
    (db, username, branch_hier, revision)

- New feature Confirm/Correct Leafiness checks 
  results when fetching items in the viewport.
  This is a big "gotcha", since items in a 
  child branch may have been moved outside 
  the bbox in question, therefore the SQL 
  SELECT won't find the leafier items.

Two Biggies in this checkin:

(1) Debugged item saving's decode_request, which uses much of the new GrAC code
    ported from flashclient, as well as some new code. The new item policies
    are applied to new items being saved, the user's access is checked on items
    being saved, and the user's group access settings are consumed.  I still
    need to debug the SQL that saves items to the database, and I have to
    finish implementing saving group_permissions and returning conflicts and
    permissions errors to the user.

(2) Implemented stacked branching in the SQL statements. For branches, SQL 
    checkout now retrieves items from each branch, and weeds out duplicates, 
    keeping items from the leafiest branch in which they appear. Committing 
    items is much easier, since items are only saved to the branch the user 
    is working on (but permissions are still considered based on the branch 
    hierarchy, so it's still a little tricky). Changing to stacked branching 
    affects lots of SQL, including the command classes, the item classes, 
    mapserver, and routed.

==========

* Fixed from_gml() in a lot of the item classes (it was missing!).

* Lots of changes to these pyserver files: 
    grax/grac_manager.py
    grax/
    item/item_user_access.py

* New grac_error collection maintains list of permissions and conflict 
  failures on commit, so server can return a complete list of problems 
  to the client (as opposed to throwing GWIS_Error on the first error, 
  which would make the user's task tedious to correct all errors).

Updates to pyserver and flashclient to run against the latest database 
schema (I checked in updated database upgrade scripts yesterday).

==========

Moved and renamed some files to be more consistent and understandable.

* Renamed Group_Access to Group_Item_Access and Group_Item_Access to 
  Item_User_Access. The names of these classes were misleading: 
  the (former) Group_Item_Access class is an intermediate class in 
  the item hierarchy, not something in the group access hierarchy.

* Moved some files into flashclient/items/utils and pyserver/item/util

==========

Lots of bugfixes to item commit in pyserver.

* Renamed item_attachment, item_geofeature, item_link_value to just 
  attachment, geofeature and link_value, to fix a problem in item_factory.

* Lots of syntax fixes to the group access code that I ported over from
  flashclient, but which hasn't been completely tested and debugged.

schema (I checked in updated database upgrade scripts yesterday).

==========

* Reorganized the item type subpackage:

** In pyserver, made item/attc, item/feat, and item/grac 
   packages and removed item/type package.

** In flashclient, made items/attcs, items/feats, and items/gracs 
   packages and removed items/types package.

** New package, pyserver/grax, similar to flashclient/grax

* Renamed pyserver_glue.commit() to transaction_commit() to
  match transaction_begin().

* Duplicated (and re-coded in Python) a bunch of files from flashclient 
  to pyserver, including:
    grax/access_level 
    grax/grac_manager
    grax/item_manager 
    grax/new_item_policy
    grax/new_item_profile
    item/grac/group
    item/grac/group_acess
    item/grac/group_membership
    item/grac/group_revision
    item/grac/new_item_policy

==========

* Added new Access Level: 'arbiter'

** E.g., owner, arbiter, editor, viewer, client, denied.

** Arbiters can edit the permissions of editors and below, 
   but cannot edit the permissions of owners or other arbiters.

==========

* Added new Access_Scope table

** Replaces is_public, is_private and is_shared.

** Got rid of link_value's value_item_id: you can just use value_integer.

** Added link_value.value_date

==========

* Added two buttons to Access tab: Make Private Copy, and Make Public.

* When user logs in, now hiding the "Sign Up" link, otherwise the user's 
  name (e.g., "Welcome, Landon!") appears truncated (with ellipses), 
  because it doesn't have enough room (e.g., "Welcome, ...")

* To accomdate what were post_revision items, link_value can now link 
  attachments to attachments, i.e., posts to attributes.

  ** Changed attc_stack_id and feat_stack_id to lhs_stack_id and rhs_stack_id.
     By convention, the left-hand-side is always the attachment. The right-
     hand-side is either a geofeature or another attachment.

==========

* Pyserver fetches should run noticeably faster.

  ** Audited all the tables and added INDEXes as appropriate.

  ** Audited all the SQL and pulled cp_*() fcns. from WHERE clauses,
     otherwise SQL runs the fcn. for every row it fetches.
     
  *** E.g., replace "WHERE valid_until_rid = cp_rid_inf()" with 
                    "WHERE valid_until_rid = %d" % (..., )

==========

A handful of changes to the database upgrade scripts and the V2 schema.

* Highlights

** Added post_revision to upgrade, so now all V1 tables are upgraded.

** Fixed database performance issues affecting both pyserver/flashclient 
   and the upgrade scripts.

NOTE: This is an incomplete checkin. I need to update pyserver, but I want 
      to check this in so I can check it out and start running the upgrade 
      scripts on it, to double-check that what I'm checking in work (and 
      the script take 10 hours to run, I think, so the upgrade will be 
      ready tomorrow morning.

==========

* Fixed schema/102-apb-* upgrade script performance problems.

** Scripts now manage constraints and indexes more deliberately,
   creating or dropping them as appropriate to improver performance.

*** The route_step table takes 8 hours to upgrade. All other scripts 
    should run in less than 2 hours. The last time I ran the upgrade 
    process, it took 24 hours: i.e., I eliminated 14 hours of bottleneck, 
    but I was unable to reduce the route_step table upgrade time.

** Removed cp_*() calls from SQL statement and made pl/PgSQL variables 
   to cache the value, so SQL doesn't call functions that return static 
   values.

==========

* Finally figured out how to handle V1's post_revision table.

** Made a new interval attribute, /post/revision, so post_revision 
   rows are now link_value rows that link a post to an attribute.

* Per post_revision, links are no longer strictly linking an 
  attachment and a geofeature, so I renamed attc_stack_id and 
  feat_stack_id to lhs_stack_id and rhs_stack_id. As in, left-
  hand side and right-hand side, as in equations.

** https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sides_of_an_equation

==========

* Fixed mapserver performance problems.

** Fixed tilecache_update.py (converted to V2 SQL).

** Renamed byway_name_cache to tiles_cache_byway.

*** Added GIST index to geometry column to improve bbox fetches.

** Renamed and recreated old views; coded to only fetch public items.

*** tiles_draw_byway (table; was byway_name_cache)

*** tiles_draw_byway (view; was byway_joined_current)

*** tiles_draw_terrain (view; was bmpolygon_joined_current)

==========

* Added new Access Level: 'arbiter'

** E.g., owner, arbiter, editor, viewer, client, denied.

** Arbiters can edit the permissions of editors and below, 
   but cannot edit the permissions of owners or other arbiters.

==========

* Added new Item Type: 'route_step'

** (It was partially implemented before, but not in all three 
    projects, i.e., SQL, pyserver and flashclient.)

==========

* Added new Access_Scope table

** Replaces is_public, is_private and is_shared.

** Got rid of link_value's value_item_id: you can just use value_integer.

** Added link_value.value_date

==========

* Removed scripts/worhints

Item Saving (Mostly complete in the client, 
                 not so much in the server)

* Client changes:

** Fixed crash on map load when you try to use tools before the 
   map is done loading.

*** Mouse listeners are not added until map is ready (otherwise, 
    responding to mouse events can crash the client).

** Changed login popup to use Help_Links that use external link 
   icon.

** More implementation of the Group Access tab.

*** Added ComboBox dataProvider array to Access_Level.

*** Added list of Group objects to Grac_Manager.

**** When Group_Membership for user is received, it populates 
     Grac_Manager.groups.

*** New intermediate class, Item_Access_Scope, replaces/improves 
    is_public, is_private, and is_shared properties.

*** Fixed reading of public and private group IDs of logged-in user
    (they were getting set to 0).

*** Moved Group_Access and made to derive from Grac_Record (an 
    Item_Versioned intermediate class).

** Fixed bug when selecting item in map and quickly clicking away:
   Detail_Panel's on_show would get called, but the selected set 
   would be empty (or set to the Branch), so the panel would crash 
   trying to set itself up.

*** Added should_show() fcn. to check that the selected items set 
    matches the item type that the panel shows.

** Lots of changes to Widget_Access*.mxml panels.

*** Figured out the bug w/ Grid and DataGrid: they need to be wrapped 
    by Canvas, otherwise they're taller than their containing component, 
    and so the component bleeds underneath and over other components.
    This hides other components, and the Grid itselfs bleeds underneath 
    some other components, so even using the scroll bar is useless, 
    since the control doesn't think it needs a scroll bar, so it doesn't 
    enable it (which would not help much, anyway, since the down arrow 
    is hidden beneath other components, anyway).

* Server changes:

** Removing plpgsql fcns. from SQL queries: run the plpgsql 
   command first and use string substitition to make the 
   final query. If you use inline plpgsql functions, you 
   can dramatically slow down the SQL queries.

** Added indices to a few more tables' columns.

*** FIXME: We need to audit all of the tables to make sure they 
           are all properly indexed.

** Fiddled with ids_translate, making it fit better into the class 
   hierarchy. That is, rather than having one fcn. that checks the 
   item type of the item whose ID is being fixed, there's now a base 
   class fcn. which calls other class fcns. which derived classes 
   override to implement specific behavior.

*** Using uniform naming convention: stack_id_map is a misnomer; 
    it's really a client_id_map, since the IDs are not stack IDs, 
    they are negative IDs from the client's working copy.

** Instead of sending is_public/is_private/is_shared, now sending 
   "access scope", an int that's 1/2/3, i.e., private/shared/public.

** Replaced revision_check_access_current & revision_check_access_historic
   with access_level_enforce, which does a better job checking the user's 
   rights to do particular operations.

** Renamed item_get/item_put to checkout/commit, since Cyclopath shares 
   lots of similarities with popular source revision control software.
   Also, item_get and item_put do not just deal solely with items, they 
   also marshal ratings, watchers, and group access control information.

Merged Mikhi's work on Route Analytics.

* Code is still a little buggy.

* FIXME: Checking in pyserver/rpy2 and 
         scripts/routing_analysis/pychart, but

  (a) I'm not sure Route Analytics uses this code;

  (b) It's third party code, so it probably should 
      not get checked in?

Changes to route daemon code.

* ratings.py, tgraph.py, and route.py

* Hopefully my changes don't conflict with Michael's 
  efforts; the Route Analytics code affects the 
  route finder code.

* Route daemon tracks revision now, rather than using 
  a timestamp to determine when it needs to update 
  the transportation network graph from the server.

Lots of UX changes.

Some of these changes are requests from James Andrew and 
Greta Alquist voiced during a quasi-useability test last 
Friday, March 25. (The GUI was done, but not everything 
was wired, so I got feedback on the GUI.)

And ome of these changes are because I got side tracked fixing 
some UX bugs I found while implementing the new GUI. Some of 
the UX bugs existed in V1, and some of them I introduced in V2.

* Moved "Atlas" panel from Branch details and made into its 
  own special panel, as requested by Greta and James. For now, 
  it's the "MAPS" button next to the "?" help button. I'm not 
  sure if this is the best place for it, or if the name is right 
  or if it should be an icon, but I do like its new prominence 
  in the GUI. Before, it was buried and hard to find, which 
  diminished its importance.

* Added "external link icons" to all the help links that link to 
  the text wiki. Using external link icons is a convention used 
  by Web developers. This also lets us use normal links to link 
  to panels and things within the flashclient application. We 
  also will avoid irritating users who expect to know if a link 
  takes them to a new Web site or to a new tab within their browser.

* Changed the text below the Cyclopath banner. For anonymous users, 
  in V1 it says, "Not logged in". But I do not like negative messages, 
  so I renamed it, "Welcome!" There is a "Sign Up" link next to it, 
  and a "Log In" button above it to the right, so I do not think 
  we need to tell the user they are not logged in.

  ** Also added a toolTips to the label.

* Changed the Bikeability button to say "Please login" when it's 
  disabled because the user is not logged in. In V1, it says, 
  "Don't Know" which is confusing to me. We should indicate to 
  the user that the button is disabled because they are not logged 
  in. Also, "Don't Know" is another negative statement. I like  
  positive messages!

* Per a request from James and Greta, got rid of the "Close" button 
  on the Attachments panel. Greta mentioned that she didn't 
  understand where she was in the GUI after opening a Note. And the 
  "Close" button is placed near the Notes edit box, and it doesn't 
  indicate what's being closed, so Greta was unsure how to return 
  from the Notes panel and go back to the Geofeature panel. So I 
  made the navigation into another Web-ish standard using angle 
  brackets and displaying the level of the panel above.

  E.g., 

    Lyndale Ave >> This is my note

  where "Lyndale Ave" is a hyperlink back to the geofeature panel.

* Got rid of the Empty Selection panel. Greta pointed out that 
  this panel is meaningless now that we can show the Branch details.
  It's also confusing to her: why does it look different when an item 
  is selected then when it's not? But always showing a details panel 
  and never showing the Empty Selection panel, the user will always 
  recognize when they are viewing the Items tab, and the user will 
  not have to click to get to Branch details, it will just be there.

* Reduced the size of the "Map Key" button in the map when it is 
  minimized. When the browser is narrow, this button is wider than 
  the browser and the "Map Key" text can get hidden under the side 
  panel. Also, it's just too big. It should be a better citizen 
  and manager its use of screen real estate better by hiding in the 
  corner when it's not in use.

* Added pagination to the Conflicts and Maps panels, e.g., 

    << < Page 1 of 2. > >>

  Though it is not implemented and it should be moved to its own class.

* New Side_Panel class takes some functions out of UI.as, including

    Side_Panel.item_details_panel_update();
    Side_Panel.history_browser_update();
    Side_Panel.discussions_panel_update();
    etc.

* Major changes to mouse handling.

  ** Fixed the Double_Click_Detector class that I recently added.

  ** Coordinate event handlers better. The Map Canvas, the Geofeature 
     sprites, Geofeature Vertices, and the Tools all respond to mouse 
     events, but if something handles an event, the others should not 
     necessarily handle it, too. Also, if a double click could still 
     happen, the new code makes sure not to complete any mouse up 
     events until it can determine if the user is double clicking or 
     not.

* G.app.canvas was renamed G.app.map_canvas when I was tracking down 
  a bug. I did not change it back because map_canvas is a more unique 
  name and makes it easier to search the source code for its usages.

* Reworded the help panel to not be so verbose. This makes the panel 
  look nicer and less intimidating.

* Renamed the tab titles to be single words the end in 's', such that 
  they follow the rules of parallelism.

  E.g., Routes, Items, Settings, Discussions, Watchers, Changes.

  Why?
  
  ** "Control Panel" is synonymous with "Settings" but does not 
     follow the convention that the other titles use (ending in 's').
     Also, "Settings" seems less computer-geeky to me. Control Panel 
     is something you find in your Windows Start Menu.

  ** "Watched Regions" is now "Watchers" since you can watch 
     any item, not just regions.

  ** "Recent Changes" is just "Changes" because, really, they are 
     not just recent changes, they are all changes.

* Fixed the Zoom widget when loading the map for the first time. This 
  was a V2 regression: clicking the zoom widget when loading Cyclopath 
  for the first time did not work (the widget would change, but the 
  zoom would not, and clicking the widget again after the map was 
  loaded also did not work as expected (the widget would go to a 
  different zoom level than the one that you pressed)).

* Help_Link now has a complement, Hyper_Link. The former is for 
  external links, and is displayed with an external link icon; 
  the latter is for links within the application (currently 
  just the navigation title you see when looking at an 
  Attachment panel).

* Enabled mouse wheel for zooming in and out. It uses a timer so 
  that it is not overly sensitive, otherwise users could find 
  themselves zooming a lot more than they intended.

* Fixed V1 bugs:

** Bug 2085
   Mouse/Keyboard Events: Shift ignored after TabNavigator used

** Bug 2088
   Alt-Tab from Attachment panel crashes debug plugin 

** Bug 2089
   Notes Undo does not update edit control 

** Bug 2090
   Dragging map after clicking on item pans map but also selects item.

* This checkin (should) compile but the source needs to be cleaned up. 
  I commented out a lot of things that I want to delete, but I wanted to 
  checkin a snapshot before deleting them, just to have a record of the 
  changes without having to do an SVN diff (or having to clean up the 
  code now, I suppose =).

What I showed James (Met Council) and Greta (Mn/DOT) last Friday, March 25.
(Not many changes since the previous checkin, however).

* New map mode dropdown: Viewing and Editing
  (minimally implemented; in viewing mode, 
   flashclient just pretends that user only
   has viewer access to items, even if user 
   might have editor access).

* New Double_Click_Handler class so that we do
  not need two, specially implemented double 
  click timers in two different classes, 
  Map_Canvas_Controller and Geofeature. Having
  just one double click handler makes it easier 
  control who handles the double click (in V1, 
  oftentimes the same mouse event would be 
  handled by more than one object).

* Reordered fcns. in views.panels.Tab_* files.

* Minor changes to Control Panel's Filter tab:
  Removed newline to improve layout.

* Don't expect to be able to build this checkin.

Lots of work on the panel classes.

 * Much like Michael and I did for the Map Tools, I added checks to see if the
   user can create each Attachment type.

   * In the panels, this info. enables/disables buttons, like "Add New Note".
   
   * It also shows/hides the "X" delete button in the tag and note lists.

 * Made new misc.utils.Objutil for some functions from G, like G.consensus and
   G.null_replace.

 * Fixed m4_ASSERT*() calls. Turns out m4 only strips newlines because of
   commas. So my compiler error line numbers were not matching my source file 
   line numbers.

 * Rating picker dropdown says "Please login" when it is disabled, rather than
   "Don't know" (former seems more cheery and helpful, and less negative).

Details Panels changes (views.panels.*):

  1. New intermediate classes for Tab_Panels_*: Tab_Panel_Base.as and Tab_Panel_Shim.mxml.

     Two tiny classes to do things common to their descendents, of which there isn't much.

     (It would just be one class, but I needed both an AS and an MXML file.)

  2. Re-organized fcns. within files into common, shared order.

  3. Removed panel_initialized and some other junk we don't need.

  4. Removed (zoom_is_vector:Boolean=true) from toggle_enabled/toggle_enabled_impl.

  5. Renamed dp_resize() to on_resize().

  6. Renamed this.selected to this.items_selected (selected is used a lot throughout the code, and it's almost always a Boolean, but here we use it as a Collection, so I renamed it to make that distinction more obvious).

Reformatted MXML XML. (1) It now matches views.panels.* module. (2) It uses consistent three-space tabs like the rest of the code instead of 4-3-3 tabs. (3) Per popular XML style guides, to increase readability, only one key/value pair per line.

Indexing all the columns in group_item_access. My test suggests most queries went from four-tenths of a second to just a few hundredths of a second (though getting 1000 byways still takes a half-second). This does not solve the slowness in the flashclient, which happens when drawing byways, highlights, and labels. Oh, and I've read you're not suppose to just index every column willy-nilly in SQL, so we may want to not index all the columns, really. But for now, things seem much faster, so, go for it, I say. At least until we learn otherwise.

== Renamed Files ==

See packages:

  views.dpanels.* (now views.panels)
  views.mxmls.*   (now views.widgets)
  gwis.*

The Detail_Panel classes are all renamed. I tried to categorize them logically into their sub-groups: the Panels themselves, then the tabs, and then the widgets on the tabs.

I also renamed the GWIS classes significantly. E.g., I renamed GWIS_PutItem (WFS_PutFeature) to GWIS_Commit, since we're using the branch model now and that function doesn't just update items, it updates a few other things, too.

== Code Conventions ==

Applied *_Base naming convention to a few more base classes.

Added Loggers to a bunch of classes.

== Miscellaneous ==

Consumed Michael's previous changes (except I split an } else { ;).

Implemented Item_Watcher.

Implemented GWIS_Commit but have not tested. Also have not tested the Tools."

m4_ASSERT_SOFT replaces m4_ASSERT_WARNING: Intent is to log an error with the server but not to alert the user.

Created two class hierarchies to help update Map_Canvas and synchronize network requests.
- Partially debugged. 
- Fetching tiles seems quicker compared to previous weeks.
- Redundant network requests are ignored (not sent). 
- Separated fetching of branch, revision, and viewport items into different subclasses. Should reduce bandwidth and hopefully make it easier to maintain code.
- Implemented callLater infrastructure for sending, receiving, and processing network data, so we don't starve the GUI.
- Implemented cancellation mechanism for cancelling in-progress updates, such as when user pans or zooms, changes revisions, logs in or out, or or changes branches.
- Stubs for fetching new item policy and updating working copy (and getting branch conflicts).
- Need to debug lots more, but builds and loads tiles at vector level, and you can pan/zoom. Just don't zoom in too far, there's bugs very near the surface.
- Package is views.update and classes are GWIS_Update and Update_Manager_Base but I think the classes aren't named quite right.

A month's worth of changes:

- New Map_Canvas_Update class serializes WFS calls when loading the map. This
  improves load time by removing redundant requests and by loading items in
  parallel. It improves application responsiveness by using CallLater to handle
  redraws and handle user interaction while processing WFS responses and
  loading features to the map. The class also uses a work queue to send WFS
  requests and to discard features, etc., while waiting for WFS responses, and
  responses are processed in a particular order (e.g., Terrain is processed
  and drawn first, then Byways, then Waypoints, then highlights and labels).

- Removed Sprite from the Item_Versioned hierarchy. This means Attachments and
  Link_Values and lightweight objects (though not quite flyweight!). E.g.,
  loading 4,000 Link_Values when Link_Values are derived from Sprite causes
  flashclient to run out of memory; loading 4,000 Link_Values when the class is
  not derived from Sprite does not cause memory issues and happens in just a
  few milliseconds.

- Implemented fetching Attributes. One-ways are now drawn appropriately, and
  the Block Details "Advanced" tab now shows the correct values. Annotations
  also now loaded, and clicking 'more' on an Annotation highlights all the
  blocks that have the annotation. So read-only use of the map should be
  completely implemented, save for bugs (mostly null pointer exceptions).

- Added WFS_GetConfig_Draw to request the draw config on startup, and to
  request it just once. (Previously, the draw config was duplicated in each
  GetItem response and was sent a number of times.)

- Changed the SQL schema script to not make Link_Values for Attributes that are
  NULL. This reduces the number of Link_Values in the system by over 100,000!
  (The net benefit is reduced load on the client when updating the map.)

- New debug log mechanism makes writing, viewing and analyzing trace messages
  simple, fast, effective... and fun!

- Watched Regions (public and private) were broken in last checkin and now
  work.

Remaining:

- Saving to the new schema is only partially implemented and completely
  untested.

- Diffing the new schema is implemented but probably broken and/or buggy.

- Posts and Threads are still not loaded, but Map_Canvas_Update should make
  implementing these easy, and we can fix the bug where three 
  WFS_GetDiscussions are sent every time the Discussion Panel's draw() command 
  is called (meaning there's currently a ton of unnecessary GML packets on the 
  wire).

- Complete test cycle. I'll write a test document for this and have different
  members of the team test different parts of the software.

- Code cleanup: remove comments and make bugs for FIXMEs that can be deferred
  until a later release; fix style issues.

- Full review: diffbr will be of limited value. I'll ask different team members
  to review different groups of code: SQL schema script; Item_Versioned
  hierarchy; Detail_Panel hierarchy; Debug Logging facility; Map_Canvas_Update.

- pyserver, flashclient, GML, SQL updated to new schema

- Remaining work:
-- Wire flashclient's byway attributes (they're there but not plugged into Detail_Panel)
-- PutFeature still needs work on both ends
-- pyserver's discussions code needs attention
-- There are plenty of bugs

- Everything still needs testing, as most errors happen at runtime, so this will take an unknown while; at least progress is easy to gauge -- I can indicate what I've tested. Maybe now's a good time to write a test document for all of us to use?

- I changed a lot of discussions code since threads and posts are integral to attachments and geofeatures, and that code was mixed in a lot with those classes.

- I changed a lot of filenames and code conventions; I have good reasoning behind the changes. I will create some wiki pages and schedule time during a research meeting so we can discuss this. Since I'm changing all of the classes in the feature-versioned hierarchy, now seems like a good time to rename those files, and also to standardize names, i.e., be more consistent with what we call things.

- The code is very messy, with FIXMEs littered everywhere, and old code commented-out but nonetheless mixed in with new code. These are all hints to help me while testing and debugging and will be removed once I get everything working. I'll also do general cleanup, like grouping and alphabatizing public and protected functions, something I do at the end when overhauling whole files, since it doesn't make sense to spend time on these tasks until you've settled on function names and visibility.

- The new schema breaks a lot of scripts in scripts/, so we'll have to decide what scripts need updating now, and which can wait until later.

- I have more items but this is the bulk of 'em.

Filename changes; I'll make a wiki page and we can discuss this in a research meeting. Since I'm reworking the feature_versioned classes and touching all of those files anyway, it makes sense to do this now. This also makes my workflow a lot easier; hopefully others will enjoy a similar benefit. But like I said, we'll discuss this and come to a concensus. In the least, I think our vocubulary should be consistent, so that the same things don't have multiple names.

Almost ready to see if pyserver runs; there's a little cleanup left and the SQL isn't tested.

1. region.comments now picked up and made into new link_values and annotations

2. Changed CREATE OR REPLACE to just CREATE and removed all DROP TABLEs -- now that the revert script is writ, we can be more strict.

3. Created VIEWs for all the TABLEs moved to the archive schema. For TABLEs of the same name (geofeature, tag, etc.), I made VIEWs named with a _fv and updated other VIEWs to use the new names.

4. The byway_segment VIEW fakes values for one_way, speed_limit, etc., until pyserver is updated to use the new attributes table. This should allow us to test the new database sooner.

5. Commented-out routes, watch_regions, and work_hints until figured out.

6. Collected all the FIXMEs at the bottom of the file so I know what's left to do.

Fix restart and stop options of routedctl: wait for routed to stop before
reporting successful stop (and, in the case of retry, starting the new
process).

This will prevent inadvertently running multiple routed's at once.

Before using 'restart', use 'stop' and make sure the existing routed process
ends.

Modified route-finding algorithm to weight intersections.

Routes through intersections can be weighted on whether
it is a left or right turn, or if it passes relatively
straight through the intersection.  

Configuration options were added to CONFIG.template.

The algorithm itself wasn't modified, instead the graph
is modified by expanding intersections.  A node is added
for each edge touching an intersection, weighted edges 
are then added between all of the intersection nodes.

When a new route is found, the client will now pan

(Bug #75)

zoomto in the client will clamp the requested zoom
level to the min or max level in the configuration
file.  It returns true if a zoom was performed, 
and false otherwise.

In order to facilitate fixing bug #75, a new function
"lookat" was defined.  lookat takes a DisplayObject
and pans and zooms to look at the object.
