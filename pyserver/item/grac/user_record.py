# FIXME: See htdocs/mediawiki/extensions/CycloAuto.php:
# you could make this an item type and manage CRUD access to it 
# that way, right? only basemap owners can get a list of users?
# or can anyone get a list of users? and only a user can edit/see 
# their own record directly.
#
# FIXME: how do you distinguish between asking for a list of items rather than
# asking for the item directly, i.e., so the list of items represents a
# read-only view (possible abbreviated view) of the item details, and the
# direct item read is more for someone who wants to edit the item, so the
# latter (sending all item details of just one item) maybe requires edit access
# to the item?
